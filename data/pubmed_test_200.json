            "their contribution has gone beyond academic research  the team of researchers in the national institute of mental health and neurosciences ( nimhans ) , bengaluru , karnataka , india , has developed indigenous ect devices that have stood the test of time in terms of their use in clinical practice as well as in their contribution to research .",
            "it delivered bidirectional stimuli , and facilities for measuring various parameters of electrical dose had been incorporated in the device . with the demonstration of cognitive superiority and comparable efficacy of brief - pulse ect ,",
            "the national workshop on ect ( 1988 ) recommended the development of state - of - the - art ect devices with brief - pulse waveform to be available indigenously .",
            "a committee including the member of the bengaluru chapter of the national institution for quality and reliability , a psychiatrist ( bng ) , and a biomedical engineer ( vsc ) took up the task of developing a brief - pulse ect device indigenously .",
            "after several laboratory tests , the machine was finally found suitable for safe use in 1992 .",
            "the focus on the simplest of the models was the ease of use by psychiatrists .",
            "this was possible by a simple microcontroller unit that transmits a brief - pulse ( 1.5 ms as width ) of bipolar nature ( at a frequency of 125 pulses / s ) and constant current ( 800 ma ) .",
            "ten steps of stimulus dose was made available by adjusting the total duration of stimulus from 0.2 s to 3.6 s and keeping current , pulse width , and pulse frequency constant .",
            "the first two stimulus steps were 30 mc and 60 mc ; the next eight steps were in multiples of 60 mc up to 540 mc .",
            "the stimulus was delivered by pressing the switch provided on the hand - held electrode .",
            "the duration of stimulus was preprogrammed based on the total charge chosen and would be shorter if the switch was released earlier .",
            "the same switch also started a seconds counter to help time the observed motor seizures .",
            "the treating physician should keep the switch pressed to let that seconds counter on ; release of switch at the termination of seizure stops the counter and indicates the duration ( in seconds ) of the motor seizure .",
            "release of the switch earlier than 20 s ( failing to see the convulsion of duration longer than 20 s ) automatically would increase the stimulus dose setting to next level for re - stimulation if the doctor chooses to do so .",
            "features such as internal trigger to disconnect the electroencephalograph ( eeg ) electrodes from external amplifiers during stimulus helped using standby eeg / electrocardiograph ( ecg ) monitoring free of artifacts .",
            "this allowed changing the settings of other electrical parameters such as pulse width and frequency if required while keeping the default setting same as the earlier microcontroller - programmed steps .",
            "however , it gave liberty to set either 10 steps of increment as in the basic model or 20 steps increase of 15 mc as 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 ,  up to 540 mc .",
            "automatic upgradation of the stimulus dose , if the observed seizure was < 20 s , was preserved . by 1994 ,",
            "the computer monitor would display the eeg in two , four , or eight channels along with ecg .",
            "after eeg recording is terminated , a 10-s calibration signal of 100 v was recorded .",
            "there was also option of choosing different eeg settings , including number of channels , and display size ( zoom ) .",
            "this refined eeg and computerized model is in use in nimhans since 1993 . in 19981999",
            ", the option of automatic setting of threshold stimulus dose in mc , by feeding data on age , sex , and inion - nasion distance ( ind ) , was developed .",
            "the research related to measurement of impedance and stimulus threshold of ect in nimhans contributed to it . around the same time , feature to store ect seizure and ecg for offline analysis was made available . with popularity of bifrontal ect ( bfect ) , special concave stimulus electrodes were added .",
            "most recent development includes facility of administering ultra - brief - pulse ( < 0.5 ms ) ect that is expected to cause lesser cognitive dysfunction .",
            "the latest integrated ect machine , with four - channel eeg / ecg , has intelligent features to independently operate without interfacing with a computer system .",
            "eeg / ecg is displayed on 5.7 \" color graphic lcd screen , and it also has sd card memory and printer interface .",
            "a separate portable eeg amplifier independent of ect can remain attached to the patient and the signals can be seen on any hand - held device that has bluetooth .",
            "all ect machines at nimhans are periodically calibrated for pulse width , frequency , amplitude , and stimulus duration stages . the frequency and duration",
            ", this device has been used to administer ect to about 700800 patients annually . with each patient receiving about 67 ects on an average through his / her course ,",
            "the precision and flexibility of electrical parameters provided by this ect machine have fostered quality research on ect at nimhans .",
            "we have selected for review those studies from nimhans which have utilized specific features of this device .",
            "stimulus relative to seizure threshold is more critical than the absolute stimulus . a few techniques of threshold estimation included the half - age method and dose titration method but have limitations .",
            "the former was dependent on the model of the device while the latter might expose the patient to inadequate stimuli .",
            "the study at nimhans in this regard on 100 consecutive patients receiving bilateral ect ( blect ) revealed that age was the most important predictor of threshold stimulus accounting for 23% variance in multivariate analysis .",
            "the other significant but less robust factors were ind and severity of illness that accounted for 5% and 4% of variance in threshold , respectively . the psychotropic medications and head circumference were not noted to influence the threshold .",
            "a formula as mentioned below for determining stimulus threshold was devised using forward stepwise linear regression model based on age alone and was prospectively tested at the 1 and 6 ect sessions .",
            "t1 = 1.67 ( age ) + 48.7 t6 = 1.8 ( age ) + 71.9 t1 = threshold at 1 session , t6 = threshold at 6 session .",
            "the computerized version of stimulus setting allows use of this regression equation with ease . with the computerized version , ect sessions of each patient",
            "a similar effort was made to find the seizure threshold for unilateral ect ( ulect ) . here , age was the only significant predictor of seizure threshold ( 15% of variance ) .",
            "a formula based on regression analysis was developed which is as follows : threshold ( mc ) = exp ( age   + 3.667387 ) , where unit of age is years .",
            "then , in an independent sample ( n = 30 ) of patients receiving ulect , the threshold was estimated ( but not administered ) using the above formula .",
            "the value obtained was rounded off to the nearest higher level on the ect device .",
            "this estimated threshold was then compared with the actual threshold stimulus which was determined by using the titration method .",
            "the results showed that 22 ( 73% ) patients would have developed adequate seizure with the first stimulus estimated by the formula method , but it overestimated threshold stimulus by 3060 mc in majority of them .",
            "moreover , it underestimated the threshold in 8 ( 27% ) patients . hence , the formula method may not be suitable for threshold estimation in ulect .",
            "however , if the ect administrator wishes to use it , he or she should do so with the stimulus set at one or two levels lower than the formula - estimated threshold estimation , and further titration may be done as needed .",
            "although stimulus at 26 times the threshold intensity is associated with greater clinical efficacy in ulect , the guidelines were less clear about this in blect .",
            "from 2006 , there was change in practice in nimahns and unless otherwise requested from the referring psychiatrist , all blects are administered at 1.5 times the threshold stimulus charge . before 2006 , the threshold stimulus was administered for blect .",
            "hence , a retrospective data analysis was done to see whether new practice has better outcome .",
            "the data of 100 consecutive inpatients who received blect at threshold level before the change in practice implemented were compared with that of 101 who received blect at 1.5 times threshold level after the change implemented .",
            "the outcome measures were the number of ects administered and the number of inpatient days after the start of ect .",
            "however , the change to suprathreshold blect conferred advantage in the treatment of mania : those receiving suprathreshold ect achieved clinical improvement with , on an average , 2 ects less and their inpatient days reduced by 10 days .",
            "ect guidelines mandate the need for seizure monitoring during ect . initially , feasibility , reliability , and validity of eeg seizure measurement were studied at nimhans using a separate paper eeg machine .",
            "subsequently , a paperless eeg amplifier , which was attached to a computer monitor displaying the eeg , was designed at nimhans .",
            "display of both eeg and the digital counter showing time duration was triggered by the ect stimulus switch ( currently , eeg monitoring is available in a display in the ect machine obviating the need for a computer attached to the ect machine ) .",
            "this paperless eeg was validated against a paper eeg measurement which showed high correlation in terms of seizure duration ( intraclass correlation , r = 0.99 , p < 0.001 ) . in later studies using this paperless eeg machine , unequivocal absence of epileptiform transients for five or more seconds on both channels",
            "the use of this paperless eeg simplified eeg monitoring by reducing mechanical problems associated with paper eeg and simplified the storing process .",
            "( 1998 ) monitored 158 consecutive patients referred for ect on their first ect for both motor and eeg seizures .",
            "around 40% of patients with prolonged eeg seizures had a seizure duration > 180 s , necessitating termination .",
            "motor seizure of 90 s failed to predict prolonged eeg seizures ( 120 s or more ) in 60% of occasions . a sizable minority ( 8% ) failed to obtain adequate motor seizure on the cuffed forearm although their eeg seizures were considered adequate by the study criteria ( 25 s ) .",
            "a similar study was conducted by mayur et al . with 232 consecutive patients posted for either blect ( 54% ) or ulect ( 46% ) . in this study ,",
            "16% had prolonged eeg seizures , 39% of which was missed by motor monitoring , and 7% of adequate eeg seizures were classified as inadequate by motor seizure monitoring . around 1% of sessions with ulect and 11% with blect were considered inadequate by motor seizure monitoring despite adequate eeg seizures .",
            "motor seizure correlated well with eeg seizure when the latter was adequate but not when prolonged .",
            "these findings were again replicated in a further larger study with 485 consecutive patients receiving either blect or ulect . in the later study ,",
            "two patients classified as having inadequate motor seizures ( < 15 s ) had prolonged eeg seizures ( > 120 s ) .",
            "patients with prolonged seizures were younger , had lower seizure threshold , were more likely to receive a diagnosis of mania , and were treated with lithium .",
            "the above studies emphasize the need for eeg monitoring during ect to prevent unnecessary re - stimulation when motor seizures monitoring incorrectly label the treatment as inadequate and also to detect and abort the prolonged seizures , which appears to be common in indian setting .",
            "a study was conducted on 287 consecutive consenting patients receiving either blect or ulect to explore the factors influencing ratio of motor and eeg seizure duration ( me ratio ) .",
            "patients were classified into low ( 0.8 ; n = 146 ) and high ( > 0.8 , n = 141 ) me - ratio groups .",
            "significantly , more patients in the low me - ratio group received blect , had prolonged eeg seizure , and were on concurrent lithium compared with the high me - ratio group .",
            "this study underscores the importance for eeg monitoring at least inpatients receiving lithium and blect .",
            "recent international guidelines have recognized the limitations of seizure duration as a marker of adequacy of treatment and emphasize the pattern of eeg seizure .",
            "a study was conducted to compare the old definition of seizure adequacy ( based on seizure duration ) with the new definition ( a seizure with polyspikes and a 3-hz activity ) in 102 computerized eeg recordings .",
            "this suggested that seizures meeting newer criteria almost invariably last for at least 25 s ; in the indian context , the change in the criteria would make little change in the day - to - day practice of ect .",
            "numerous ictal eeg markers have been elucidated to predict treatment response of ect including postictal suppression , postictal coherence and amplitude , amount of slowing and time to onset of slowing , global eeg power , largest lyapunov exponent , and strength symmetry index ( ssi ) .",
            "ssi was computed from the early- and mid - seizure eeg epochs using the fractal dimension ( fd ) .",
            "the seizures of ulect were characterized by significantly smaller ssi in both phases , despite having seizure duration comparable to blect . it was suggested that ssi may be a potential measure of seizure adequacy . in another study ,",
            "ssi was computed in 40 patients receiving either high - dose or low - dose bitemporal ect ( btect ) .",
            "ssi of the early seizure was higher in the high dose than in the low dose ect group .",
            "another method of analyzing eeg is to measure the components of the eeg such as its frequencies across several nonoverlapping frequency bands : delta , theta , alpha , and beta through fast fourier transform .",
            "the delta band of eeg is said to be relevant to the therapeutic properties of ect .",
            "eeg of 25 patients receiving either blect or ulect was subjected fast fourier transform , and the spectral power of the delta ( 14 hz ) band was computed .",
            "blect resulted in symmetrical seizure spectral power ; ulect seizures had significantly lower spectral power in the delta band on the unstimulated side .",
            "fd was computed for early- , mid- , and post - seizure phases of the first ect .",
            "fd is a geometrical method of analysis of eeg , which was calculated based on the principles described by katz .",
            "it is a measure of complexity of the eeg wave in the terms of amplitude and frequency .",
            "smaller postseizure fd after the 1 ect was associated with remission status at 2 weeks .",
            "smaller postictal fd was considered a marker for postictal suppression suggesting that postictal suppression may be a marker for early antidepressant response for ect .",
            "a similar study was conducted in 51 right - handed , drug - free patients with major depressive disorder receiving right ulects at 2.5 times their seizure threshold .",
            "spectral power ( db ) for 26 hz band and fd of postseizure eeg were estimated .",
            "smaller fd and spectral power ( i.e. greater postseizure eeg suppression ) were seen in early responders compared to the late responders .",
            "ictal eeg fd was calculated from 26 eeg records of patients receiving either bfect or btect for schizophrenia .",
            "maximum fd at the 2 or 3 ect had an inverse correlation with psychosis severity after 6 ects as well as with the number of ects provided .",
            "hence , maximum fd during the early part of the ect course in schizophrenia patients is predictive of greater benefit in short - term psychopathology . in another analysis of data from the sample",
            ", it was seen that maximum fd does not change over six ects despite decline in seizure duration over ect .",
            "thus , eeg morphology of blect induced seizures show little variation over the course of treatment which is in keeping with other studies .",
            "bispectral index ( bis ) measures the level of hypnosis ( sedation ) during anesthesia .",
            "bis values of awaked individuals with schizophrenia were studied through a course of bitemporal brief - pulse ect .",
            "it was recorded using a bis monitor ( a-2000 , aspect medical systems inc . , newton , massachusetts , usa ) , with sensor applied to the forehead on the right side .",
            "it was found that after six ects , 60% of patients had their resting bis values in the anesthetized / sedated range even when they are awake .",
            "thus , bis may not provide accurate estimation of the depth of anesthesia during ect after the initial ect sessions .",
            "bfect is found to be as efficacious as btect for depression but associated with fewer cognitive adverse effects .",
            "however , its efficacy in other indications had not been well studied and hence , it was planned in nimhans . assessing",
            "bfect in acute mania in double - blind randomized controlled trial showed faster decline in ymrs scores and earlier attainment of response compared to btect without differences in adverse effects .",
            "a double - blind , randomized controlled trial demonstrated the superior clinical as well as cognitive effects of bfect over btect in - patients with schizophrenia .",
            "seizure duration significantly reduced only with bfect and not with btect over the course of ect .",
            "this provided the indirect support to possible better anticonvulsant mechanism of action of bfect in schizophrenia .",
            "these studies used electrodes with inner concave surface specifically for bfect and later , we have been using these electrodes in clinical practice for bfect in nimhans .",
            "the effect of electrical stimulus parameters of ect on prolactin response was studied . stimulus dose , frequency of ect , and seizure variables such as seizure duration , seizure strength , pattern , and symmetry",
            "did not predict chance in prolactin level . similarly , none of the clinical variables including baseline severity of illness , presence of psychotic symptoms , drug - naive status , and degree of clinical improvement predicted the prolactin response .",
            "the prolactin response however , was significantly more in female participants which may be due to their lower seizure threshold and inherent biological predisposition .",
            "a study comparing low- and high - stimulus doses in a double - blind , randomized controlled design revealed that eeg seizure was of comparable duration in the two stimulus groups .",
            "another study with a cross - over design looking into the effect of different stimulus frequency found that lower pulse frequency ( 50 pps ) stimulus had lower seizure threshold and produced fewer subconvulsive stimulations compared with high - frequency stimulus ( 200 pps ) without altering seizure durations or the cardiovascular responses .",
            "the low - frequency stimulus produced similar clinical benefits as that of high frequency in subsequent study .",
            "thus , lowering down the frequency of pulses may be a viable option when seizure threshold is high due to various reasons .",
            "the lower stimulus frequency leads to longer stimulus train duration and hence , had lower rate ( mc / s ) of stimulus dissipation .",
            "the cardiovascular system ( cvs ) effects of ect were also studied with the features of automated cardiac monitor and ambulatory ecg system in eeg machine . to study the effect of atropine on cvs response to ect , 30 patients were randomly allocated before the third ect to receive atropine or no premedication and found that atropine contributed to 32% of the variance in rate pressure product ( rpp ) with lower values in those who did not receive atropine . however",
            "this study hence indicated that avoiding atropine as premedication can control rpp and thus can improve cardiac stability during ect without affecting other aspects . in a large sample of 124 patients",
            ", it was found that postictal rpp was significantly higher after blect than ulect even after eliminating the effect of possible confounding variables such as subconvulsions and concurrent medications .",
            "the difference of 10% postictal rpp increments between the right ulect and blect groups found in this study is of clinical relevance in elderly or patients at risk of cardiac complications .",
            "the postictal rpp may be considered as a peripheral marker of the degree of seizure generalization .",
            "in addition , if the hypothesis of seizure generalization to hypothalamus as a prerequisite for clinical efficacy is given consideration , then lower rpp of threshold ulect compared to blect can explain lower clinical efficacy of ulect and may reflect the less than optimal hypothalamic stimulation .",
            "the correlation of rpp with clinical efficacy was further supported by the lower postictal rpp with unilateral threshold ect compared to that with unilateral suprathreshold ect .",
            "however , atropine could mask the differential cardiovascular responses of the effective and ineffective seizures . in another study ,",
            "the effect of anesthetic modification of motor seizure on rpp was also explored . 1 mg / kg dose of succinylcholine improved the number of patients with successful modification compared to 0.5 mg / kg but did not influence ictal or postictal rpp .",
            "it thus ruled out the significant cvs alteration due to depolarizing effect of succinylcholine and 1 mg / kg dose may be used routinely without fear of exaggerated cvs response .",
            "it confirmed the above findings that rpp response correlates with the cerebral seizure instead of motor component of seizure .",
            "ictal rpp did not differ between groups with or without adequate motor seizure if eeg seizure was adequate . however , the group with inadequate eeg seizure had the least ictal rpp .",
            "hemodynamic response with btect and bfect were examined at five - time points starting from before anesthesia induction to 2 min after the seizure .",
            "the maximum values of systolic blood pressure , heart rate , and rpp were similar in both groups , suggesting that cardiovascular load is similar in bfect and btect .",
            "it also indicates that differential frontal lobe stimulation rather than seizure generalization may be playing a role in better efficacy of bfect over btect in schizophrenia .",
            "lithium given concurrently with ect can have serious interactions with various aspects of the procedure . at the same time , not combining ect and lithium in certain patients may have adverse clinical consequences . in the absence of systematically collected data on adverse effects of lithium co - prescribed with ect ,",
            "patients on lithium ( n=27 ) and those not on lithium ( n=28 ) were compared while they received ect .",

            "the most relevant finding in this study is that igm antioxldl ab showed a significant correlation with different signaling pathways ( inflammation , apoptosis , and lipid metabolism ) in a highly atherosclerotic environment . to study signaling pathways , there are some important points to consider .",

            "it has been demonstrated that the atherosclerotic process is accentuated in large arteries where hemodynamic forces are exerted ( 20 ) .",
            "we demonstrate that in both a vein and an artery , plasma levels of igm antioxldl ab correlate with these signaling pathways , indicating that this antibody was expressed in a determined environment ( atherosclerotic medium ) independently of the analyzed vessel",
            ". this event does not occur with igg antioxldl ab . of all biochemical and anthropometric characteristics of these patients with diabetes , in accord with other studies ( 9,11 ) , only plasma c - ldl levels showed a negative correlation with igm antioxldl ab .",

            "with respect to inflammatory biomarkers , it is known that during plaque formation , muscle cells migrate from the media to the intimal layer , where they proliferate and generate growth factors , such as vegfa . in the past decade , vegfa was believed to be a proinflammatory biomarker in endothelial cells involved in the atherosclerotic process ( 23 ) . in the present study ,",
            "expression of vegfa is associated with igm antioxldl abs in both fv and opa , demonstrating this relationship .",
            "another inflammatory biomarker , tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( tfpi ) , is a potent regulator of the tissue factor pathway that together with ldl modulates tissue factor function ( 24 ) .",
            "other proinflammatory biomarkers are the metalloproteinases , which are a family of zinc - dependent endopeptidases , and they are a major contributor to plaque rupture ( 25 ) .",

            "as such , it depends on the amount of cholesterol in lipid - laden macrophages ( 27 ) inside atheroma plaque . in peripheral cells ,",
            "the lipid uptake by scavenger receptor initiates chronic proinflammatory cascades linked to atherosclerosis . in this sense",
            ", the present study demonstrates that scarb1 is positively correlated with igm antioxldl ab levels in opa .",
            "in addition , another lipid biomarker is a nuclear hormone receptor , pparg , which also is positively correlated with igm antioxldl ab levels in fv .",
            "pparg agonist - mediated inhibition of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system and the thromboxane a2 system as well as endothelial protection may possibly be involved in the inhibitory effects on blood pressure and atherosclerosis ( 28 ) in this vessel ; thus , the atherosclerotic process is not developed in this environment .",
            "activation of pparg by its ligands could modulate gene transcription , such as nfkb , thereby leading to multiple antiatherogenic and fibrinolytic effects ( 29 ) .",
            "in fact , nfkb also shows a positive correlation with igm antioxldl ab levels in fv .",
            "when igm antioxldl ab levels were analyzed in relation with some biomarkers of the apoptosis pathway , we found that akt1 , casp3 , and bax in fv and only akt1 and bax in opa showed a positive correlation with igm antioxldl ab .",
            "recently , it was demonstrated that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells , oxldl - induced apoptosis was associated with upregulation of proapoptotic bax and casp3 and inhibition of antiapoptotic akt1 accompanied by reciprocal changes in the methylation of promoter regions of these genes ( 30 ) . in this sense , it could be hypothesized that because of this correlation between these biomarkers and igm antioxldl ab , this antibody has a protective function in atheroma plaque .",
            "on the other hand , it was demonstrated that casp3 cleaves specifically with cdkn1a and may trigger the apoptosis pathway ( 31 ) .",
            "the expression of this gene is modulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53 ( 33 ) . in this study , a positive correlation between cdkn1a and igm antioxldl ab was found in opa . in conclusion , the results of this study show that the gene expression of the apoptosis , lipid metabolism , and inflammation metabolic pathways in the fv and opa vessels is directly related to the levels of igm antioxldl ab . because this is a cross - sectional study , we could not determine whether igm antioxldl ab has a proinstability effect in plaques , whether it exerts a protective compensatory response , or whether it is merely a correlative marker for the presence of inflammatory cells in patients with diabetes ."

            "for the us , information on resistance in , more or less , the same bacteria are available from intensive care units ( 11 , 13 ) . though the figures for the eu and the us are not quite comparable , table 1 gives an indication of the prevalence of resistance in these two regions . \n ",

            "it has been suggested that these differences can be partly explained by differences in antibiotic use between countries ( 9 ) . as to trends in resistance ,",
            "the findings in the ecdc / emea joint technical report indicate that , for europe as a whole , shares of resistant isolates , despite some variation from one year to another , have been fairly constant over time for most of the bacteria in table 1 .",

            "the ecdc / ema - report also presents estimates of the consequences of resistance in terms of annual number of infections , additional deaths , extra hospital days and societal costs ( direct health care costs and the value of productivity lost ) caused by the selected bacteria ( cf .",

            "in particular there seems to be a lack of new antibiotics expected to be effective in resistant gram - negative bacteria ( 3rd generation cephalosporin resistant e. coli and klebsiella pneumonia , and carbapenem resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa ) .",
            "a further cause for concern is the fact that pharmaceutical firms seem to have reduced investment in r&d for antibiotics in favour of other drugs with more promising financial incentives ( 1 , 1825 ) .",
            "thus , although the data above do not present an encompassing picture of the resistance problem , they do suggest that it is significant and causes substantial societal costs .",
            "on a general level , there seems to be consensus that there is a need for doing two things ( 1 ) preserve the efficiency of present substances by restricting use and , ( 2 ) increase the supply of new substances brought to the market ( 1 , 4 , 12 ) .",
            "unfortunately , as preserving the efficiency of present substances entails restricting use , the two objectives are partly opposing and not easy to achieve simultaneously .",
            "the discussion below uses examples from human medicine and there are concerns that the use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine may be an equally large problem .",
            "moreover , resistance to drugs used in veterinary medicine may potentially affect resistance to drugs used in human medicine , and vice versa .",
            "however , as the problem is similar , the measures to address it will also be similar . to preserve the efficiency of existing drugs , the need for guidelines for good antibiotic stewardship has been emphasised .",
            "such guidelines have also been developed in several countries , although their implementation is not straight forward ( 2630 ) .",
            "they include , inter alia , recommendations to increase hygienic measures to control resistance in hospitals and community homes , to condition all use of antibiotics on prescription , to restrict use to bacterial infections only , and emphasise the importance of choosing the optimal therapy with regard to substance , administration , dosage and duration ( 2735 ) . however , hygienic measures to control resistance in the institutional setting are not without costs to hospitals and nursing homes . restricting use to bacterial infections and choosing the optimal therapy",
            "requires access to quick and reliable diagnostic facilities which may be a problem outside the hospital setting .",
            "thus , faced with concerned patients presenting symptoms not easily diagnosed , physicians may have incentives to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics with potential adverse effects on resistance . informing the public on the issues involved",
            "might make a decision not to prescribe ( until test - results are available ) more acceptable , but this is by no means certain as the individual patient , while gaining the full benefit if treatment is effective , will not bear the full ( societal ) costs of increased resistance if it is not ( 3638 ) .",
            "note that the opposite problem applies to hospitals and other institutions when determining if the implementation of stricter hygienic procedures is worthwhile ( i.e. the institution will bear the full costs of the procedures in question while sharing the benefits with society at large ) . to provide patients and institutions with incentives to consider the full societal costs of antibiotic use",
            ", it has been suggested that a fee corresponding to the expected costs of resistance should be levied on the use of antibiotics ( 1 , 38 ) .",
            "one problem with this solution is that the fee 's demand - constraining effect may be limited if expenses for antibiotics are covered by insurance- or other third party payer systems .",
            ". however , that could raise concern regarding the access to antibiotics for less affluent patients ( and countries ) and , therefore , not be acceptable to policy makers .",
            "the optimal fee should equal the expected marginal costs of resistance caused by antibiotic use ( 39 ) .",
            "if it is set higher , demand will be reduced by too much ( i.e. the health benefits from a marginal increase in use will exceed the expected costs of resistance caused by that marginal increase in use ) and , if it its set lower , demand will be reduced by too little ( health benefits from a marginal increase in use will be smaller than the expected costs of resistance caused by that marginal increase in use ) . as the effects of use on resistance are not fully understood , and may differ between substances , optimal fees can not be expected .",
            "one might consider determining the fee on the basis that it , for a given antibiotic , should generate enough returns to finance the development of a successor during the period it takes until resistance becomes a problem for that substance .",
            "this requires information on development costs and time until resistance becomes a problem which is likely to depend on the antibiotic in question .",
            "however , some knowledge may be gained from past experience . while development costs are the property of pharmaceutical firms and , therefore , not easily accessible , some estimates do exist ( 4044 ) .",
            "similarly , there are estimates of the time from introduction to detection of resistance for several substances ( 45 ) . to determine the fee per unit of substance required to raise the necessary funds , information on the annual amounts consumed of different substances would also be needed .",
            "a fee determined in this way is of course unlikely to be optimal in the sense defined above .",
            "however , it is also unlikely to be too high since one result from studies estimating development costs is that these have been rising continuously since the 1970s .",
            "accordingly , while it may not be large enough to achieve an optimal reduction in antibiotic consumption from the perspective of preserving efficiency , it may at least go part of the way . on the other hand ,",
            "if the consumption of antibiotics is reduced , this could increase the problem of achieving the other objective  increasing the supply of new antibiotics .",
            "the supply of new antibiotics is dependent on research and development ( r&d ) to discover and market them .",
            "the outcome of this process depends on how difficult it is to identify substances with the desired characteristics .",
            "this , in turn , is a function of our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved , and of the requirements of the approval procedure .",
            "the less that is known about the biological mechanisms , the more resources are needed to uncover the issues involved .",
            "similarly , the stricter the requirements for approval , the more resources are needed to satisfy them .",
            "our understanding of the biological mechanisms is imperfect ( not least regarding the mechanisms causing resistance ) , suggesting that r&d costs may be substantial .",
            "however , the literature does not indicate that they are significantly higher than for other types of pharmaceuticals ( 46 ) .",
            "the bulk of the r&d work is carried out by pharmaceutical firms that depend on sales revenues for financing their operation .",
            "of course , the larger the costs of r&d are in relation to the ( expected ) revenues , the smaller the incentives for pharmaceutical firms to engage in the process .",
            "the revenues are a function of the amounts sold and the price of the drug in question . here , there are indications that revenues from antibiotics may be lower than those from other classes of pharmaceuticals that are prescribed for longer periods ( 18 , 20 , 25 ) .",
            "accordingly , it appears that insufficient financial incentives to engage in r&d is an important reason for the paucity of new antibiotic substances .",
            "several measures to increase the supply of antibiotics by changing incentives , ranging from changing the requirements for approval of new drugs , over tax - credits for research and public - private partnerships , to prolongation of patent duration , have therefore been discussed and suggested ( 1 , 13 , 18 , 19 , 46 ) .",
            "there certainly appears to be good reason to make adjustments in the requirement for approval .",
            "for instance , it is not clear why clinical trials for each infection  pneumonia , urinary tract infection , skin and soft tissue infection , etc .",
            " should be required for approval of the use of a certain drug in their treatment if these infections are caused by the same bacteria .",
            "thus , one suggestion is to condition approval on demonstrated efficacy towards specific organisms rather than specific infections ( 13 , 19 ) .",
            "this might also increase incentives for pharmaceutical firms to invest in developing drugs with a narrow spectrum relative to broad spectrum drugs , which would reduce resistance caused by the use of antibiotics .",
            "the evidence is mixed in that , while they do increase incentives , effects appear to be limited since taxes only constitute a small part of the development costs .",
            "public - private partnerships in r&d for antibiotics may be a solution for specific drugs with very limited markets ( xdr / pdr acineobacter and kleibsella ) but could not , and should not , replace the efforts of private firms in r&d to replace antibiotics not facing these market limitations .",
            "a patent excludes the holder from competition from generic substances which provides a monopoly position with the potential of gaining larger revenues from higher prices .",
            "however , patents are often sought early in the development process and , due to the longevity of this process , they may only last for a short period after the drugs are approved and marketed .",
            "increasing the duration of patents for antibiotics might , therefore , provide better incentives for their development .",
            "however , the higher prices charged by the monopolist will also affect demand , and it has been shown that this may restrict the use of antibiotics by too much from the societal perspective ( 4750 ) .",
            "in addition , the revenues obtained may not necessarily be invested in the development of new antibiotics as they compete for resources with other pharmaceuticals that may be perceived to have better net present earnings ( 18 , 20 , 25 ) . finally , strengthening the monopoly position of patent holders may have detrimental effects on competition which could reduce incentives to develop new substances .",
            "an alternative strategy may be subsidies targeted directly at the development of new antibiotics as this would compensate for lower expected sales revenues in comparison to other pharmaceuticals , particularly if measures to constrain the use of antibiotics are successfully applied .",
            "these subsidies of course needs finance which may be difficult to secure given tight government budgets .",
            "however , as noted above , if a fee is levied on the consumption of antibiotics as a measure to preserve the efficiency of existing drugs by containing their use , the proceeds from this fee could be used to finance such targeted subsidies . in this context",
            ", it may be noted that the demand - constraining effects of the fee would be less of a problem ( i.e. if the fee does not reduce the use of antibiotics very much , the revenues raised and available for the financing of subsidies to develop new substances would be larger ) .",
            "that is , the responsible body must have the competence to evaluate the potential of different research ideas , which is a very demanding task .",
            "to preserve the efficiency of existing drugs , the need for guidelines for good antibiotic stewardship has been emphasised .",

            "thus , faced with concerned patients presenting symptoms not easily diagnosed , physicians may have incentives to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics with potential adverse effects on resistance . informing the public on the issues involved",

            "note that the opposite problem applies to hospitals and other institutions when determining if the implementation of stricter hygienic procedures is worthwhile ( i.e. the institution will bear the full costs of the procedures in question while sharing the benefits with society at large ) . to provide patients and institutions with incentives to consider the full societal costs of antibiotic use",
            ", it has been suggested that a fee corresponding to the expected costs of resistance should be levied on the use of antibiotics ( 1 , 38 ) .",
            "one problem with this solution is that the fee 's demand - constraining effect may be limited if expenses for antibiotics are covered by insurance- or other third party payer systems .",
            "however , that could raise concern regarding the access to antibiotics for less affluent patients ( and countries ) and , therefore , not be acceptable to policy makers .",
            "the optimal fee should equal the expected marginal costs of resistance caused by antibiotic use ( 39 ) .",
            "if it is set higher , demand will be reduced by too much ( i.e. the health benefits from a marginal increase in use will exceed the expected costs of resistance caused by that marginal increase in use ) and , if it its set lower , demand will be reduced by too little ( health benefits from a marginal increase in use will be smaller than the expected costs of resistance caused by that marginal increase in use ) . as the effects of use on resistance are not fully understood , and may differ between substances",
            "one might consider determining the fee on the basis that it , for a given antibiotic , should generate enough returns to finance the development of a successor during the period it takes until resistance becomes a problem for that substance .",
            "this requires information on development costs and time until resistance becomes a problem which is likely to depend on the antibiotic in question .",
            "while development costs are the property of pharmaceutical firms and , therefore , not easily accessible , some estimates do exist ( 4044 )",
            ". similarly , there are estimates of the time from introduction to detection of resistance for several substances ( 45 ) . to determine the fee per unit of substance required to raise the necessary funds , information on the annual amounts consumed of different substances would also be needed .",
            "a fee determined in this way is of course unlikely to be optimal in the sense defined above .",
            "however , it is also unlikely to be too high since one result from studies estimating development costs is that these have been rising continuously since the 1970s .",
            "accordingly , while it may not be large enough to achieve an optimal reduction in antibiotic consumption from the perspective of preserving efficiency , it may at least go part of the way . on the other hand ,",
            "if the consumption of antibiotics is reduced , this could increase the problem of achieving the other objective  increasing the supply of new antibiotics .",
            "the supply of new antibiotics is dependent on research and development ( r&d ) to discover and market them .",
            "the outcome of this process depends on how difficult it is to identify substances with the desired characteristics .",
            "this , in turn , is a function of our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved , and of the requirements of the approval procedure .",
            "the less that is known about the biological mechanisms , the more resources are needed to uncover the issues involved .",
            "similarly , the stricter the requirements for approval , the more resources are needed to satisfy them .",
            ", our understanding of the biological mechanisms is imperfect ( not least regarding the mechanisms causing resistance ) , suggesting that r&d costs may be substantial .",
            "however , the literature does not indicate that they are significantly higher than for other types of pharmaceuticals ( 46 ) .",
            "the bulk of the r&d work is carried out by pharmaceutical firms that depend on sales revenues for financing their operation . of course , the larger the costs of r&d are in relation to the ( expected ) revenues , the smaller the incentives for pharmaceutical firms to engage in the process .",
            "the revenues are a function of the amounts sold and the price of the drug in question . here , there are indications that revenues from antibiotics may be lower than those from other classes of pharmaceuticals that are prescribed for longer periods ( 18 , 20 , 25 ) .",
            "accordingly , it appears that insufficient financial incentives to engage in r&d is an important reason for the paucity of new antibiotic substances .",
            "several measures to increase the supply of antibiotics by changing incentives , ranging from changing the requirements for approval of new drugs , over tax - credits for research and public - private partnerships , to prolongation of patent duration , have therefore been discussed and suggested ( 1 , 13 , 18 , 19 , 46 ) .",
            "there certainly appears to be good reason to make adjustments in the requirement for approval .",
            "for instance , it is not clear why clinical trials for each infection  pneumonia , urinary tract infection , skin and soft tissue infection , etc .",
            " should be required for approval of the use of a certain drug in their treatment if these infections are caused by the same bacteria .",
            "thus , one suggestion is to condition approval on demonstrated efficacy towards specific organisms rather than specific infections ( 13 , 19 ) .",
            "this might also increase incentives for pharmaceutical firms to invest in developing drugs with a narrow spectrum relative to broad spectrum drugs , which would reduce resistance caused by the use of antibiotics .",
            "the evidence is mixed in that , while they do increase incentives , effects appear to be limited since taxes only constitute a small part of the development costs .",
            "public - private partnerships in r&d for antibiotics may be a solution for specific drugs with very limited markets ( xdr / pdr acineobacter and kleibsella ) but could not , and should not , replace the efforts of private firms in r&d to replace antibiotics not facing these market limitations .",
            "a patent excludes the holder from competition from generic substances which provides a monopoly position with the potential of gaining larger revenues from higher prices .",
            "however , patents are often sought early in the development process and , due to the longevity of this process , they may only last for a short period after the drugs are approved and marketed . increasing the duration of patents for antibiotics might , therefore , provide better incentives for their development .",
            "however , the higher prices charged by the monopolist will also affect demand , and it has been shown that this may restrict the use of antibiotics by too much from the societal perspective ( 4750 ) .",
            "in addition , the revenues obtained may not necessarily be invested in the development of new antibiotics as they compete for resources with other pharmaceuticals that may be perceived to have better net present earnings ( 18 , 20 , 25 ) . finally , strengthening the monopoly position of patent holders may have detrimental effects on competition which could reduce incentives to develop new substances .",
            "an alternative strategy may be subsidies targeted directly at the development of new antibiotics as this would compensate for lower expected sales revenues in comparison to other pharmaceuticals , particularly if measures to constrain the use of antibiotics are successfully applied .",
            "these subsidies of course needs finance which may be difficult to secure given tight government budgets .",
            "however , as noted above , if a fee is levied on the consumption of antibiotics as a measure to preserve the efficiency of existing drugs by containing their use , the proceeds from this fee could be used to finance such targeted subsidies . in this context",
            ", it may be noted that the demand - constraining effects of the fee would be less of a problem ( i.e. if the fee does not reduce the use of antibiotics very much , the revenues raised and available for the financing of subsidies to develop new substances would be larger ) .",
            "that is , the responsible body must have the competence to evaluate the potential of different research ideas , which is a very demanding task .",
            "the previous review has , while by no means being exhaustive , pointed at some of the problems in addressing the challenge from antibiotic resistance .",
            "basically , they arise from the fact that the two objectives  preserving the efficiency of existing substances and increasing the supply of new antibiotics  are partially opposing . thus , while several measures to achieve either one of them have been proposed in the literature , each with their own pros and cons that need to be considered , the problem remains that the more successful measures are in achieving one of the objectives , the more difficult will it be to achieve the other .",
            "notwithstanding , the idea of levying a fee on antibiotics and use the proceeds to finance targeted subsidies may , at least partly , reconcile them .",
            "also , measures aimed at facilitating the approval process do not necessarily limit the possibilities of containing the use of antibiotics .",
            "this suggests that more resources should be directed to the further development of these two strategies .",
            "a further problem is that , ideally , measures to address antibiotic resistance should be applied on a global basis .",
            "this , of course , requires international cooperation which has proved to be complicated in other circumstances .",
            "given the global nature of the resistance problem , as well as the fact that pharmaceutical firms operate on a global basis , the who seems to be a natural candidate for shouldering the responsibility of developing solutions to the implementation of the measures suggested in the literature .",
            "however , national governments may be reluctant to give up legislative power ( which might be called for if principles of good antibiotic stewardship should be equally enforced in all countries ) or the control of funds ( which may be the implication of using the proceeds from a fee on antibiotics strictly for the development of new substances ) .",
            "nevertheless , actions taken by national governments may go a long way to reduce the resistance problem , as visualised by the differences between countries in the eu in the magnitude of the problem .",
            "lack of incentives and awareness are important reasons for why the problem of antibiotic resistance is difficult to overcome .",
            "increasing incentives for supplying new antibiotics requires funding to subsidise r&d costs . to increase awareness ,",

            "this study showed that nematodes can reduce d. v. virgifera emergence in all three of the soil types tested .",
            "however , the higher efficacy in soils with high clay and silt content was surprising because several previous studies suggested that sandy soils provide good conditions for nematode survival , movement , host finding behaviour and infectivity ( e.g. , kung et al .",
            "our results suggest the opposite is true for d. v. virgifera control in maize fields .",
            "only barbercheck and wang ( 1997 ) also found that h. bacteriophora killed more larvae of diabrotica undecimpunctata barber in loam than in sand .",
            "our study does not provide much insight into which factors might have prevented the nematodes from being more effective in the sandy soils .",
            "one explanation for the apparently high efficacy of nematodes in non - sandy soils might be that the nematodes were applied too close to maize roots and d. v. virgifera ( here 150  mm ) to detect a reduction in nematode movement in heavy soils with low sand content .",
            "it is known that movement of nematodes can be restricted in dense soils such as clay or silty clay ; whereas , strong movement can usually be observed in loamy sand or sandy soil ( barbercheck and kaya 1991 ; barbercheck 1992 ; portillo aguilar et al .",
            "( 2006 ) reported that the mobility of s. carpocapsae was greater in marine sand than in sandy loam soil , and koppenhoefer and fuzy ( 2006a ) showed that the infectivity of s. scarabaei slightly declined from sandy soils to fine clay soils , whereas no such effects were reported for h. bacteriophora and h. zealandica . despite the advantages of sandy soils , nematodes may still find their hosts easier in clay soils than in sandy soils when moving along cracks formed by plant roots or the host larvae . in sand , however , they will disperse more equally and the net - movement towards the host larvae may therefore be less directed .",
            "another possible explanation for our results is that the survival of d. v. virgifera larvae is usually high in heavy soils ( turpin and peters 1971 ; beckler et al .",
            "2004 ) , such as clay , and would therefore provide most host larvae for nematode attack and propagation .",
            "gaugler ( 2002 ) reported that nematodes usually have an advantage over insecticides in that they propagate within the pests and thus can react to high pest densities .",
            "this was also suggested for h. megidis when applied against d. v. virgifera in maize fields in the usa ( i. hiltpold 2008 , personal communication ) .",
            "however , in our study , the time period required for nematode propagation ( 12-week period ) would hardly be enough to infest more larvae because the applied larvae already started to pupate and emerge as adults ( toepfer and kuhlmann 2006 ) .",
            "moreover , our results suggest that high sand content , in contrast to above mentioned papers , only slightly reduced d. v. virgifera survival , measured in the untreated controls .",
            "we found approximately 12% survival from late second instar to the adult stage in the silty clay with low sand content and 8% in the sandiest soil .",
            "however , the negative influences of sand to first instar larvae , such as through coarse texture or fast desiccation of sandy soils ( gustin and schumacher 1989 ; macdonald and ellis 1990 ) were excluded in this study through the infestation of plants with later less sensitive instars .",
            "such mortality factors of first instars might be the reason that greater damage from d. v. virgifera , particularly plant lodging , are more often reported from regions with heavy and dense soils than from regions with light sandy soils ( i. zseller , 2008 , personal communication ) .",
            "another reason might be that population pressure of d. v. virgifera is usually higher in regions with heavy and dense soils due to higher intensity of maize growing when compared to regions with sandy soils considered suboptimal for maize production due to soil aridity ( i. zseller , 2008 , personal communication ) . in conclusion , the efficacy data presented here suggest that nematodes might be suitable biological control agents for managing d. v. virgifera in most soils , including heavy non - sandy soils , such as those found in the intensive maize production areas of central europe . on average across soils , h. bacteriophora was more effective at controlling d. v. virgifera larvae ( 43% ) than h. megidis ( 23% ) and s. feltiae ( 11% )",

            "if left untreated , adhd can be associated with a number of poor outcomes including academic failure , delinquency , and problems with substance abuse ( barkley 1990 ; biederman et al 1996 ; dulcan 1997 ; wilens et al 2004 ) .",

            "moreover , a 5-mg dose of d - threo - mph has the same attention improvement effect as a 10-mg dose of d , l - threo - mph racemic mixture .",
            "hence , the clinical effect of mph is attributed to the d - enantiomer ( srinivas et al 1992 ) .",
            "the brand name for d - mph is focalin . in terms of its chemical composition , d - mph hydrochloride is methyl -phenyl-2-piperidineacetate hydrochloride , ( r , r)-(+)- .",
            "although its mechanism is poorly understood , pharmacodynamic studies have suggested that the therapeutic effect of mph in the treatment of adhd appears to lie primarily in increasing the synaptic concentration of dopamine by blocking dopamine transporters ( dat ) ( gatley et al 1996 ; ding et al 1997 ; davids et al 2002 ) , as well as in blocking norepinephrine transporters .",
            "this is in agreement with recent reports that there is significantly increased expression of dat in adhd patients ( volkow et al 2002 ) and the effects of mph administration is associated with a decrease in dat receptor concentration in the striatum ( krause et al 2000 ) .",
            "however , in methamphetamine abusers , the number of dat also are reduced ( volkow et al 2001a , 2001b ) .",
            "recovery of dat receptors is evident with protracted abstinence ( volkow et al 2001a ) .",
            "the binding of d - mph to dat in the striatum is reduced by cocaine in a dose - dependent manner ( fowler et al 1998 ) .",
            "studies in humans , baboons , and rats seem to indicate that the pharmacological specificity of mph resides predominantly in its d - isomer ( srinivas et al 1992 ; ding et al 1997 ; anonymous 2002 ) .",
            "thus , in vivo binding measures of radiolabeled d - mph to dopamine transporter in the brain with positron emission tomography ( pet ) or microdialysis have not only become a valuable technique to analyze pharmacodynamics of mph and its enantiomers ( ding et al 1995 , 1997 , 2004 ; gatley et al 1995 ; logan et al 1996 , 2001 ; volkow et al 2002 ; kilbourn 2004 ) , but also served as an effective tool to assess expression or density of dopamine transporters in tissues of humans and animals ( volkow et al 1995 , 1996b , 2001a , 2001b ; fowler et al 1998 ; gatley et al 1999 ) .",
            "pet studies provide a quantitative measure of distribution volume ratios , which represent specific radioligand binding ( volkow et al 1995 ; wang et al 1995 ) .",
            "measures of distribution volume ratios are based upon the following assumptions : ( i ) even if the plasma concentration of the radiolabeled tracer is unknown ( for example , without blood samples from patients ) ,  non - invasive  quantification is still possible using a reference region with graphical analysis ( logan et al 1996 ) ; ( ii ) for neuroreceptor  transporter modeling , no specific binding occurs in the reference region ( volkow et al 2002 ) ; ( iii ) the distribution volume of the reference region is the same as the distribution volume of the first compartment ( free and non - specifically bound tracer ) in the target region .",
            "since the basal ganglia of striatum expresses more dopamine transporters ( dat ) , it is considered as the target region for d - mph , while the cerebellum does not express dat , so it usually is considered the reference region ( volkow et al 2002 ; kilbourn 2004 ) .",
            "thus , the tissue distribution volume ratio of [ c]d - mph in the basal ganglia containing the specific binding to that in the cerebellum which demonstrates non - specific binding should be considered to be a reflection of dopamine transporter availability .",
            "recent results from pet and other imaging studies for the two enantiomers of racemic mph demonstrated that [ c]d - mph bound to the dopamine transporter in the basal ganglia is highly specific and reproducible ( ding et al 1997 ) .",
            "however , there is no evidence of regional specific binding for [ c]l - threo - mph in the brain .",
            "these results suggest that the binding of mph to dat in the striatum is enantiospecific .",
            "these data are also in agreement with those from basic and clinical studies showing that d - mph at therapeutic doses exerts much stronger effects than racemic mph or l - threo - mph on extracellular dopamine in rats and on improvement in sustained attention in children ( srinivas et al 1992 ; patrick et al 1987 ) . moreover , d- and l - mph also undergo enantioselective metabolism ( srinivas et al 1987 ; hubbard et al 1989 ; anonymous 2002 ; sun et al 2004 ) , as evidenced by the following findings . first , as mentioned before , because of rapid pre - systemic metabolism , orally administered l - threo - mph is poorly absorbed in humans",
            "thus , the absolute bioavailability of d - mph is significantly greater than that of l - threo - mph ( srinivas et al 1993 ; sun et al 2004 ) .",
            "second , because there is a correlation between plasma concentrations and dat occupancy , the plasma concentration could serve as an indicator for dat binding ( srinivas et al 1992 ) .",
            "however , dat binding by d - mph could also be obtained from calculated tissue distribution volume without patients blood samples ( logan et al 1996 ) .",
            "third , while the rate of brain uptake for both enantiomers was not significantly different , the rate of clearance after 1.5 hours from the brain or plasma was much slower for d - mph than that of l - threo - mph ( volkow et al 2002 ) .",
            "fourth , greater than 50% dat binding in the basal ganglia by d - mph may be required for therapeutic efficacy for adhd . however , despite greater than 50% dat occupancy by d - mph when administered intravenously or orally , the reinforcing effects were not perceived by patients receiving oral d - mph ( volkow et al 2002 ) .",
            "this phenomenon is possibly due to slower blockade of dat by oral d - mph and may explain why intravenous injection of mph may lead to addiction . finally , there is no inter - conversion between the enantiomers after oral administration of pure d- and l - mph separately ( volkow et al 2002 ) .",
            "the recent in vitro binding study of markowitz et al ( 2005 ) found that d - mph exhibited prominent effects at the norepinephrine transporter site , even exceeding the activity at the dat .",

            "animal toxicology studies showed that the toxicity of d - mph and d , l - mph were comparable at equimolar doses ( teo et al 2002 ) . a recent comparative study assessing the acute behavioral toxicity of d - mph , l - mph , and d",
            ", l - mph in rats has revealed that females were more sensitive than males to some toxic behavioral effects of the l - isomer and d , l - mph ( racemic ) , suggesting a possible sex difference in sensitivity ( teo et al 2003d ) . in related studies , increased incidence of dilated pupils and vocalization was found with d , l - mph compared with the pure d - mph given at half the dose ( teo et al 2002 ) . in the same study , no other significant toxic effects were found in perinatal or postnatal rats at a dose 25 times the maximum daily human therapeutic dose ( teo et al 2002 ) .",
            "another toxicology study in beagle dogs demonstrated that only minimal reversible toxicity such as reduced appetite and weight loss were found in male and female dogs receiving 10 mg / kg of d - mph and 20 mg / kg of d , l - mph for 90 days ( teo et al 2003c ) .",
            "neither d - mph nor d , l - mph were found to be carcinogenic or clastogenic in either in vitro or in vivo studies , although very high oral doses of the l - mph produce behavioral , and even lethal , effects in mice ( teo et al 2003a ) .",
            "the authors believed that d - mph and d , l - mph do not present carcinogenic risk to humans .",
            "animal studies in rats and rabbits also suggested that d - mph and d , l - mph were not teratogenic ( teo et al 2003b ) .",
            "the same study suggested that some negative behaviors in pregnant animals may be attributed to l - mph because inclusion of the l - isomer , when comparing d , l - mph and d - mph at half the dose , resulted in repetitive pawing , dilated pupil , and aggressive behavior . a recent study , using pet and micropet to trace orally administered , as well as radiola - beled d- and l - mph , in the brain of baboons and rats , suggested that l - mph may not be pharmacologically active .",
            "additionally , l - mph might contribute to the behavioral and side - effect profiles of d , l - mph during the treatment of adhd ( ding et al 2004 ) .",
            "the immediate - release ( ir ) d - mph product is deemed to provide effective management of adhd at half the dose of racemic mph products and was shown to be effective and well tolerated in clinical trials ( swanson et al 2002 ; arnold et al 2004 ; quinn et al 2004 ; wigal et al 2004 ) .",
            "an initial pharmacokinetic study showed that after an oral dose of d - mph , plasma d - mph concentration increased rapidly , reaching maximum levels at 11.5 hours post - dose in fasting states .",

            "the mean plasma elimination half - life for d - mph is approximately 2.2 hours ( anonymous 2002 ) .",
            "however , recent studies , including one post hoc analysis ( weiss et al 2004 ) , one open - labeled ( silva et al 2004 ) , and three placebo - controlled clinical studies ( arnold et al 2004 ; quinn et al 2004 ; wigal et al 2004 ) in children with adhd , suggested that ir d - mph may produce a longer duration of therapeutic action (  6 hours ) which can not be explained solely on the basis of the agent s pharmacokinetics . some authors have postulated that the need for a midday dose for ir mph products may erode social functioning and sometimes the self - esteem of children with adhd . thus , an extended - release form of d - mph ( d - mph - xr ) was designed , known as focalin xr , and approved by fda for clinical use in may 2005 .",
            "this product is a modified release capsule formulation of d - mph specifically engineered to deliver a bimodal ( biphasic ) release of d - mph that mimics a twice daily d - mph dosing ( ie , two distinct peaks approximately 4 hours apart ) .",
            "the d - mph - xr product uses the same proprietary sodas ( spheroidal oral drug absorption system ) technology as one of the racemic mph products ( ritalin - la ) currently on the market . for each of these products ,",
            "capsules are filled with a mixture of 50% immediate - release beads and 50% enteric - coated , delayed - release beads , thus providing immediate release and a second delayed - release component .",

            "additionally , there was a significant decline in average length of stay from 5.1 to 1.4 days , with no missed intraperitoneal injuries and only one significant complication ( urinary retention ) following negative laparoscopy .",

            "while it is not clear from this paper whether laparoscopy resulted in a reduction in the rate of negative laparotomy ( which was 25% overall in this combined series ) , it does indicate that laparoscopy can safely and reliably select those patients without intraperitoneal injury who can be spared a negative laparotomy . in view of these reports , and",
            "dissatisfied with our own negative laparotomy rate , prospective evaluation of diagnostic laparoscopy was undertaken with the expectation that insignificant injuries could be reliably identified , thus reducing both the incidence of negative celiotomy and hospital length of stay . in the 70 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy ,",
            "the negative laparotomy rate was 20% , and if the trivial liver injuries explored early in our experience are excluded , the rate drops to 16% .",

            "overall , the negative exploration rate for all patients with penetrating abdominal trauma treated during this time period at our institution fell from 33% to 20% .",
            "while a significant decrease in our negative laparotomy rate occurred , it is still not negligible , and this failure to eliminate nontheraputic laparotomy in one - fifth of the cases of penetrating trauma is the  achilles ' heel  of diagnostic laparoscopy as currently practiced . as our ability to laparoscopically explore the peritoneal cavity , reliably examine the large and small bowel , and perform laparoscopic repair of selected injuries improves , the negative laparotomy rate should continue to decline and can be expected to approach five percent . since bellevue hospital charges a fixed comprehensive daily rate , a true cost analysis could not be made , leaving the length of stay as the only valid index of comparison ; during the study period it was 5.2 days following negative laparotomy as compared to 1.5 days after negative laparoscopy . at current charges of $ 1,000 per day , a 3.7 day decrease in length of stay represents a $ 3,700 reduction in cost per patient , which translates into an overall savings of $ 77,700 for the 21 patients who underwent negative laparoscopy and did not require additional hospitalization for associated injuries .",
            "while primarily used to evaluate penetrating injuries , laparoscopy also proved to be a useful tool in selected blunt trauma patients with benign clinical exams and indeterminate radiologic studies .",
            "one patient had a minimal amount of free fluid in the pelvis on computed tomography ( ct ) ; laparoscopy revealed turbid fluid , and a perforation of the antimesenteric border of the proximal jejenum was found and repaired at laparotomy .",

            "three hiv+ patients with abdominal stab wounds and equivocal physical exams underwent negative laparoscopy , sparing all three an unnecessary abdominal exploration .",
            "laparoscopy has been championed by some authors as a routine maneuver in the evaluation of penetrating lower chest injuries to detect clinically and radiologically occult diaphragmatic injuries . in this study ,",
            "laparoscopy was selectively employed to evaluate those lower chest injuries felt to be at particular risk for intra - abdominal injuries , and one diaphragmatic injury was detected and repaired .",
            "however , two of the remaining ten patients with thoracoabdominal stab wounds who underwent negative diagnostic laparoscopy manifested ongoing thoracic blood loss that necessitated return to the operating room , reinduction of general anesthesia and thoracotomy for definitive control of pulmonary parenchymal bleeding . clearly , routine diagnostic laparoscopy in these patients resulted in initial evaluation of the wrong body cavity , and lulled us into a false sense of security regarding the extent and severity of injury .",
            "thus , in patients with penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma and negative diagnostic laparoscopy , we now believe that diagnostic thoracoscopy should be performed before the patient leaves the operating room .",

            "electrophysiologic studies are beginning to highlight the importance of nodal dysfunction , and they suggest that rapid reversal of disability may be tied to improvement in nodal function.1521,55,5961 classical electrophysiologic findings considered important for the diagnosis of cidp include multifocal conduction velocity slowing , distal latency prolongation , conduction block , and temporal dispersion , which have generally been considered indicative of demyelination.14,61,62 studies of axonal excitability using the responses to multiple stimuli , strength - duration relationships , and excitability - recovery protocols offer a complementary mechanism that may be particularly relevant to the clinical experience of some cidp patients . in a study of cidp patients , measurements of axonal excitability in response",
            "to subthreshold polarizing currents ( threshold electrotonus ) were interpreted as showing hyperpolarizing changes.60 in another study of cidp patients , stimulus - response curves suggested increased threshold requirements.59 nerve excitability has also been studied before and after ivig administration .",

            "remyelination or axonal regeneration , while likely important in eventual recovery , are implausible as explanations for this rapid clinical improvement.16,55 small studies of recordings obtained just before and at various time points after individual ivig doses have been interpreted to suggest that improvements in motor performance correspond to rapid but reversible changes in nodal function.1618,20 the duration of improvements in axonal excitability and muscle strength may be limited , with a return to the preinfusion baseline before the next dose of ivig is due.15,18,21 an interesting analogy may be found in a recent report of mg patients who responded to ivig .",
            "thirty - two of the 37 patients reported improvement within a few days after each ivig infusion but worsening of myasthenic symptoms a few days before their next scheduled ivig infusion.9 no change in achr antibody titers were observed , even with prolonged ivig therapy .",

            "mmn is distinguished by demonstrating multiple conduction blocks limited to motor nerves , with sparing of sensory nerves.6467 the electrophysiologically demonstrated conduction blocks have been considered a consequence of segmental demyelination , but recent studies suggest immunologic target(s ) actually on axons rather than / or in addition to schwann cells or myelin per se.67 a major puzzle in understanding mmn is the observation that corticosteroids and plex are usually not effective,64,65,67 while ivig has become the standard of care.68 approximately half of mmn patients have igm antibodies against the ganglioside gm1 , and these seropositive patients tend to have more severe weakness , disability , and eventual axon loss than seronegative patients.69 mmn patients ' sera containing igm anti - gm1 have been shown to activate complement in vitro,70,71 so it is possible that ivig is acting mainly by inhibiting c3 ( third component of serum complement system ) activation and/or deposition on ganglioside - rich domains of axonal membranes.21,71 although the complement membrane attack complex is often considered a lytic lesion which kills cells , sublytic attack can also occur , because nucleated cells can remove membrane attack complex pores by shedding or internalizing microscopic membrane vesicles.72 when this occurs , functionally important membrane proteins can be lost .",

            "have shown that in mmn , igm - induced complement - mediated injury occurs at the nodes of ranvier , which in turn leads to conduction block and muscle weakness.71 they further showed that ivig can block antiganglioside antibody binding in a dose - dependent manner.71 using stimulus strength  duration measurements to assess motor axon excitability , priori et al",
            ". showed that axonal hyperpolarization occurs in mmn , suggesting that antibody - mediated inactivation of the na+ channels at the nodal membrane contributes to the apparent conduction block.73 boerio et al . performed nerve excitability studies before and just after ivig treatment in mmn ( and cidp ) patients .",
            "they reported that ivig improved axonal excitability , which they attributed to restoration of na+ channel expression and/or activity.16 these electrophysiological observations could potentially explain why effects of ivig may improve muscle strength shortly after each infusion but wane in subsequent weeks.7375 thus , taken together , the results of these recent studies of axonal excitability in cidp and mmn , the absence of clearly identifiable effector cells attacking the involved nerves , and the rapid responses to ivig reported in both disorders suggest that autoantibodies (  complement ) may disrupt axon function in addition to inducing structural damage . in turn",
            ", the reports of rapidity and reversibility of the responses to igg infusions in some cases may suggest competition between infused therapeutic igg and endogenous pathologic antibodies.21 a corollary of this hypothesis is that the specificities , titer , and affinities of the autoantibodies being produced by any given patient at any point in time , together with the susceptibility of the target axons , may be important determinants of the treatment regimen required to optimally manage that particular patient at that time .",
            "the initial dose of ivig used for most autoimmune / inflammatory diseases follows a regimen serendipitously found effective shortly after ivig was introduced in 1981 .",
            "four cll patients with thrombocytopenia and concomitant immune deficiency had increased platelet counts after receiving what was then the standard monthly dose of ivig for antibody replacement , 0.4 gm / kg . because of the rise in the platelet count , the ivig dose was repeated the next day , then also on the remaining working days ( but not the weekend days ) of the same week , leading to a cumulative dose of 2 gm / kg given over 45 days.76 a subsequent randomized , multicenter trial comparing the 0.4 gm / kg per day  5 regimen with a single infusion of 2 gm / kg over 10 h in children with kawasaki syndrome found that the latter was more effective in preventing aneurysms and led to faster resolution of fever and biochemical markers of inflammation.77 this suggests that the peak igg level is the most important determinant of the success of therapy in some situations .",
            "however , kawasaki syndrome , like gbs , is considered an acute monophasic disease ; while cidp , mmn , and mg are chronic disorders .",
            "in current neurologic practice , a  loading dose  of 2 gm / kg divided over 25 days is usually followed by maintenance doses of 12 gm / kg every 36 weeks.68,78 infusion of 2 gm / kg of ivig increases the serum igg level > 4-fold , from pretreatment means of 7001,060 mg / dl to peaks well over 3,000 mg / dl.78 the levels then drop by approximately 50% over 4872 h , as igg is distributed into the total extracellular fluid volume , which is approximately double the intravascular volume.78,79 after this rapid equilibration , the igg is catabolized with first - order kinetics and a half - life of 2130 days , so infusions are usually repeated monthly.7881 the relatively slow catabolism of igg as compared to other plasma proteins is due to a saturable endothelial cell receptor which protects endocytosed igg from lysosomal degradation and returns it to the plasma.80,82 saturation of this receptor with high concentrations of normal igg from exogenous ivig keeps endogenous pathologic igg from the recycling pathway and increases its degradation.83 this is likely an important concentration - dependent mechanism by which ivig can compete with autoantibodies without affecting their production.21,83 reports of patients responsive but chronically dependent upon ivig support the notion that the effects of each dose are transient , without any cumulative effect.9,21 certainly , not all patients are chronically dependent on ivig ; up to 30% might achieve long - term drug free remission . whether these observations can be explained by spontaneous remission with neuronal integrity supported by ivig while the disease is in the active state , or if ivig fundamentally alters the immune process remains to be clarified . in either case ,",
            "accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that the infused antibodies in ivig compete with putative pathologic antibodies and/or complement , and that the effect diminishes as the relative concentrations of normal versus pathologic antibodies decrease with time after each dose.21,83 in contrast to intravenously administered igg , with subcutaneously administered igg ( scig ) , the initial direction of the movement of igg is opposite that of ivig .",
            "scig is first absorbed into and transported through lymphatics , then enters the bloodstream by means of the thoracic duct.84 equilibration of the igg from scig into the intravascular space requires approximately the same amount of time as equilibration of ivig out of the intravascular compartment , 3672 h.8486 the peak serum concentration achieved with scig is , on average , only 61% of the peak achieved with iv infusions of the same dose.86 the slower rate of rise toward the peak and the truncation of its height are believed to be responsible for the much lower incidence of systemic adverse effects ( aes ) with scig.84,85,87 this is consistent with numerous reports that many of the aes of ivig infusions are rate - related and can be obviated by giving the igg by the sc route.87,88 no differences have been reported in the half - lives ( t1/2 ) of igg given by the sc versus iv routes , generally reported to be approximately 3035 days with currently marketed igg products.81,85,86 because of the low incidence of systemic aes and lack of a requirement for venous access , scig is commonly self - administered at home , usually weekly.89 with weekly scig , only a few days elapse between the peak serum level from 1 dose and administration of the next dose .",
            "serum igg levels experienced 34 weeks after a large bolus of ivig.85 pooled data from 7 studies in which equivalent monthly igg doses were given as weekly scig infusions versus ivig boluses every 2128 days showed that trough serum igg levels were higher by 1020% ( mean  =  12.7% ) with weekly scig.81,85,86 after 612 weekly infusions , scig results in near - steady - state igg levels , with peak - trough differences only approximately 5% of the overall mean.85,86 in contrast , with ivig the trough - to - peak difference is often greater than 100% of the overall mean.81,89 as with any other therapy , the shorter the interval between doses , the higher the trough level and the smaller the difference between peak and trough levels are likely to be , regardless of the route of administration.81,89,90 the overall bioavailability of scig is approximately 30% lower than that of ivig , presumably because of binding to extracellular matrix and/or degradation in the tissues.91 for this reason , to achieve the same total systemic exposure to igg , defined by the area under the curve ( auc ) of serum igg versus time , it is necessary to increase the monthly dose of scig by 30 to 50% compared with the monthly dose of ivig.86,91 however , there is little evidence which supports basing doses on the auc , as opposed to the trough serum igg level .",
            "typical pk curves from ivig and scig in a patient with primary immunodeficiency ( pidd ) who makes only minimal endogenous igg are shown in figure 2a and b. the large differences in peak and trough on ivig versus the near steady - state serum igg levels with scig are readily apparent . if the effect of therapeutic igg is proportional to its serum concentration at any point in time ( for example , in pidd , the moment when exposure to an infectious agent occurs ) , it is easy to see how the effect of ivig would wane as it is metabolized and its concentration decreases .",

            "reported that serum igg levels obtained 2 weeks after ivig 2 gm / kg showed a large degree of pharmacokinetic variation and that those patients with greater increments in their serum igg levels had better clinical outcomes at 6 months posttreatment.96 in a prospective study in cidp , the same group showed that different patients required different ivig dosing intervals and serum igg levels to achieve and maintain optimal clinical responses.90 the mean trough serum igg level ( just before each dose was given ) required by the subset of these patients on a single ivig product ( n  =  17 ) was 1,500 mg / dl , but the range was 1,100 to 1,900 mg / dl.90 besides the suggestion that different patients require different igg levels to achieve maximum muscle strength , the doses and treatment intervals required to achieve and maintain any given igg level are also likely to vary greatly between individuals.90,9395,98 many immunodeficient patients report feeling better and remain free from recurrent symptoms of chronic low - grade infection when their serum igg level is maintained at a steady - state with the use of weekly scig.100 a few reports suggest that maintaining high steady state levels of normal igg by the use of scig may also be beneficial in cidp and mmn ( see below ) , but additional studies are needed . as with plex , the initial response to ivig in many patients with cidp is rapid , with symptomatic improvement beginning within days.101103 the beneficial effect generally wanes within weeks , and ivig infusions are repeated at regular intervals , often for years.104 harbo et al . reported that 6 of 11 cidp patients on individualized ivig regimens began to lose strength within a few days when their ivig was delayed beyond the usual interval.105 conversely , they began to regain strength in 5 days after an ivig dose , although a plateau was not achieved for 15 days.106 in the  ice  trial , improvements in grip strength and incat score in responding subjects were seen at the first post - ivig determination 16 days after the infusion.101103 further improvement was recorded at 3 and 6 weeks , but repeated measurements were not taken before and after subsequent doses of ivig.101  wearing off  of the effect of each dose of ivig may be a reason that as many as 30% of cidp patients had dosing intervals of 15 days in a us survey93 and    21 days in a uk study94 ( fig .",

            "monthly ivig is now the accepted first - line treatment for mmn.68,121 even so , treatment - related fluctuations in strength and  end - of - dose  weakness are also reported in this condition.125 several case reports and small case series have suggested that scig may be as effective as ivig for long - term maintenance of strength in mmn,126130 but large clinical trials have not compared the efficacy of scig versus ivig .",

            "the total monthly dose by 25% resulted in increased strength , which was stable at the peak he had previously achieved only transiently after each ivig dose.128 this improvement was accompanied by an increase in the trough serum igg level from 1,500 mg / dl to a steady state of 2,100 mg / dl , consistent with the hypothesis that the patient 's strength at any point in time is directly related to the total igg concentration of in his circulation.128 similar dose - dependency observations were reported in small prospective , open - label , noncontrolled trials in which 4 of 5 patients maintained stable mrc sum scores for at least 6 months with steady - state serum igg levels of 1,380 to 1,740 mg / dl.129,130 taken together , these results suggest that scig may be a useful alternative to ivig for some mmn patients , particularly those that experience treatment - related  wear - off  or ",
            "there remains a controversy as to whether prolonged ivig treatment totally controls the progression of mmn , or whether axonal degeneration and long term deterioration are inevitable .",
            "some studies suggest that careful optimization of therapy with frequent adjustments to avoid end - of - dose weakening may help promote long - term recovery and prevent axonal loss,124 although other reports suggest gradual worsening despite this approach.75 it may be that axon damage increases toward the end of each dosing interval , when the ratio of the putative autoantibodies to normal igg is relatively high and the patient is experiencing increased weakness . if that is the case , using scig to maintain higher steady - state igg levels without cyclic troughs may decrease long - term deterioration in mmn , but that hypothesis remains to be tested .",
            "in 2007 , the peripheral neuropathy outcome measures standardization ( perinoms ) study began.131 a major aim of this international collaboration is to better define the metrics used to follow patients with inflammatory neuropathies . in 2013 ,",
            "the group analyzed outcome measure data collected from cross - sectional validity and reliability studies as well as longitudinal studies of responses.132 the results emphasized the importance of measuring disability ( i.e. , activities and participation ) , strength and sensory impairment , and quality of life .",

            "we propose that frequent collection of validated and reliable disease - specific measures between physician visits can be used to optimize clinical care and improve outcomes .",
            "of course , continued assessment of symptoms and signs by interviewing and examining the patient during office visits is invaluable and irreplaceable .",

            "the importance of these metrics in clinical trials is obvious , but their long - term utility has yet to be studied . extending their application to routine clinical care may offer a unique opportunity to optimize inflammatory neuropathy treatment paradigms and hopefully long term outcomes .",
            "many investigators are actively seeking an immunologic biomarker or soluble indicator of neuronal damage which could be used to identify those patients who are most likely to respond to igg therapy and to monitor its effects in mmn , cidp and other neuropathies.33,62,64,90,95,96,122 in the absence of such biomarkers , frequent measurements of grip strength and of disability using r - ods may be used to better characterize treatment responses .",
            "current treatment strategies rely heavily on data obtained through unstructured and often unsolicited communication from patients as well as from infrequent face - to - face office visits .",
            "adherence to rigorous diagnostic standards3,53,62,68,122,123 and collection of focused disease - specific outcome measures at more frequent intervals may assist with development of better paradigms for optimizing treatment .",
            "prompt recognition of those patients for whom igg or other expensive biologicals are unnecessary or ineffective is another likely benefit of frequent measurements , which may aid in the development of criteria for identifying nonresponders and selecting appropriate alternatives , .",
            "although several recent reports suggest that dosing ivig as frequently as every 714 days , or the use of scig to maintain high steady - state igg levels may be preferable in terms of maintaining consistent function and minimizing disability , several questions remain unanswered .",
            "importantly , analyses of larger and more diverse populations are needed to determine which patients are characterized by a predominance of functional immunologic effects that are rapidly and reversibly responsive to igg and/or other immunotherapies as opposed to those who have mainly structural and/or permanent damage . similarly ,",
            "longer term follow - up is necessary to determine whether the kinetics of responsiveness vary at different stages of disease , and whether minimizing short - term fluctuations in strength and/or disability correlates with long term outcomes .",
            "immunologic as well as clinical studies suggest that cidp is a heterogeneous group of conditions with a multiplicity of immunologic targets and mediators .",
            "the kinetics and pattern of response to igg and other therapies may be a useful criterion according to which subsets of these diseases are classified and split - out for further studies . because igg can act by many different mechanisms , it seems quite likely that better definition of the immunopathogenesis of particular disease subtypes might lead to preferential use of different therapies , such as steroids and anti - inflammatories , complement inhibitors , or monoclonal antibodies and other narrowly targeted biologicals . in conclusion , recent studies of the immunology and electrophysiology of cidp and mmn suggest that much of the morbidity and disability in these conditions is caused by readily reversible functional effects of autoantibodies rather than more slowly repairable structural damage.18,21 these results serve as a foundation for understanding clinical observations of rapid responses and  wear - off  effects with intermittent ivig bolus therapy . together , these observations suggest the hypothesis that infused antibodies in igg actually compete with pathologic autoantibodies .",
            "observations that dosing of ivig as often as every 710 days or the use of scig to continuously maintain high steady - state igg levels may be preferable to the periodic extremely high peaks and low troughs of ivig boluses given every 46 weeks . giving smaller doses of ivig more frequently or routine weekly self - administration of scig in the home may be associated with fewer , less severe adverse effects and significant cost savings as compared to intermittent high dose ivig , which requires administration and monitoring by a trained nurse , even if given at home .",
            "additional research is needed to determine how widely applicable frequent dosing of ivig or scig might be , and whether continuous maintenance of optimal strength / minimal disability is associated with better long - term outcomes .",

            "at indiana universitypurdue university indianapolis ( iupui ) , we have developed a concept called  distributed drug discovery  ( d ) .",
            "herein is reported the first example of a key component of d : the distributed rehearsal of reagents and their subsequent use in real and virtual catalog production .",
            "the premise of d is that the availability of simple , inexpensive equipment and procedures for each of the core scientific drug discovery disciplines ( computational chemistry , synthetic chemistry , and biochemical screening ) will enable large drug discovery problems to be broken down into manageable smaller units to be solved at multiple sites throughout the developing and developed world .",
            "the recombined and coordinated results of these resources can inexpensively accelerate the identification of leads ( primarily for developing world and other neglected disease targets ) in the early stages of the drug discovery process .",
            "in addition , this effort provides educational and job opportunities in both the developed and developing worlds while building cultural and economic bridges for the common good .",
            "combinatorial virtual catalogs , realistically accessible by globally distributed synthesis , are key to the implementation of d. in classical combinatorial chemistry , reagent rehearsal increases the likelihood that any individual member of an enumerated virtual library can be synthesized from each unique combination of rehearsed reagents .",
            "however , it imposes additional strong constraints on reagent - rehearsed virtual catalogs : any member of the library must be accessible by rehearsed or precedented synthesis , anywhere in the world , using simple , inexpensive equipment and procedures .",
            "part i reports the first successful global reagent rehearsal , conducted by undergraduate and graduate students in the united states , poland , russia , and spain . in part ii , a virtual d catalog based on this work",
            "one of the most common types of intermediates used in combinatorial chemistry is the resin - bound natural or unnatural -amino acid 1 ( scheme 1 ) .",
            "the -amino acid substructure occurs in 28% of the structures cited in a recent  comprehensive survey of combinatorial library synthesis  .",
            "scheme 1 gives examples of a few of the published libraries based on 1 . with the exception of proline ,",
            "the methodology for the introduction of side chains by carboncarbon bond construction has expanded considerably the availability of these unnatural -amino acids . of the existing routes to such molecules",
            "thus , introduction of an unnatural side chain onto the -position of a suitable glycine or higher amino acid derivative by alkylation can provide , respectively , -substituted or ,-disubstituted amino acid products .",
            "because of the central role of 1 in combinatorial chemistry , and the ability to greatly expand its numbers through alkylation chemistry , we chose to focus on rehearsing alkylating agents r1x for our first exemplification of d synthesis . in the process",
            ", we wished to show the likelihood that undergraduate or graduate students would be able to make any given member of a resulting virtual d catalog , further demonstrating the potential of distributed drug discovery .",
            "we modified our published synthesis of 1(17c ) and incorporated the rehearsal into a student combinatorial chemistry laboratory that transformed 1 to the acylated derivatives 5 ( scheme 2 ) . this generic structure 5 would then become the basis of our first virtual d catalog . the time ranges shown in scheme 2 accommodated the details of laboratory scheduling in academic institutions at different geographic locations .",
            "simple , inexpensive  bill - board 6-pack  equipment ( figure 1 ) was used to carry out this procedure , six reactions at a time .",
            "every bill - board 6-pack had six reaction vessels in a grid of two rows ( a and b ) by three columns ( 1 , 2 , and 3 ) , and reactions were correspondingly identified by  row , column  ( e.g. , a1b3 ) . the equipment was designed to enable the essential steps common to most solid - phase synthetic procedures : cycles of reaction and filtration workup , followed by product cleavage , and collection .",
            "bill - board components and 2  3 experimental grid . in this first demonstration of the distributed process , twenty - four alkylating agents r1x were rehearsed , often in quadruplicate , sometimes at geographical locations remote from one another ( indianapolis , in ; lublin , poland ; moscow , russia ; and barcelona , spain ) . in all cases",
            "the quality of the crude products was assessed by lc / ms to obtain a marker of the suitability of a given reagent in combinatorial library generation .",
            "this analytical measurement of quality is not definitive because uv detection can overlook , among other things , poor absolute recovery , the presence of insoluble impurities , or soluble impurities not revealed by the detection system .",
            "nevertheless , the lc / ms data permits elimination , from a rehearsed virtual library , products based on alkylating agents that are clearly problematic . follow up synthesis and purification conducted at iupui allowed the isolation and characterization of all the unnatural amino acids reported in this distributed reagent rehearsal study . since reagent rehearsal was done by students with little to no prior experience in either organic synthesis or solid - phase chemistry , two key elements were incorporated into the laboratory : ( 1 ) students worldwide conducted the same  control  alkylation reaction , using r1x = benzyl bromide ( 6 ) in column 1 .",
            "( 2 ) the evaluation of new alkylating agents was replicated by at least one other student or student team .",
            "this worldwide distributed process permits the assessment of both the quality of the work carried out by any given student / team and the reproducible efficacy of the evaluated reagents .",
            "the first synthetic rehearsals were conducted at iupui , utilizing four concurrent laboratory sections , to pilot the process of replicated synthesis in multiple students hands .",
            "there were up to 20 students in each section . a total of 65 students operated in 32 teams of two per bill - board ( 192 reactions ) , with one extra bill - board used for the solo student .",

            "the acylating agents used in rows a and b of the bill - board were always fmoc chloride and 2-naphthoyl chloride , respectively .",
            "in this first extensive study , two commercial suppliers , i and ii , were commissioned to produce the starting benzophenone imine resin 2 . for comparison purposes , resin from source i was used in sections one , two , and four ( teams 18 , 1017 , and 2633 ) , and resin from source ii was used in section three ( teams 1825 ) . since all 32 teams prepared the same product ( fmocphe 5{6}a , see table 1 ) in position a1 of their bill - boards it was informative to analyze the quality , as a function of resin source , of all 32 of these replicated products .",

            "the ms data allowed the tentative assignment of the structures 23 , 24 , and 25 for these respective peaks ( figure 3 ) .",
            "in contrast , there were insignificant levels of the impurities at 2.5 and 4.8 min in samples prepared from resin supplier ii ( figure 2b ) .",
            "the supporting information contains a more complete discussion of the origin of these proposed impurities 23 and 24 in resin from i , and 25 in both resins from either i or ii . proposed structures for impurities produced from resin source i. although resins from i and ii were used in the initial laboratories at iupui , because of its higher quality , only resin from commercial source ii was used in subsequent laboratories at iupui , and in laboratories conducted in poland , russia , and spain .",
            "replicated alkylations ( 24 replicates ) , using the same resin and alkylating agent , gave strikingly similar results ( table 1 ) .",
            "individual results rarely differed from the average by more than 3% . as expected , because of the impurities present in the starting resin from i ( see earlier discussion and supporting information ) the purity of alkylation products from this resin was lower ( by 1520% ) than those from ii ( compare , for example , the results for the fmoc derivatives 5{7}a through 5{12}a from alkylating agents 7 through 12 , where the first two results for each compound were from resin source i , and the second two results were from resin source ii ) . nevertheless , from the same resin source the alkylation results are very reproducible . in rare cases ,",
            "this is to be expected when so many different researchers ( students ) are performing this work for the first time .",
            "for example , team 28 obtained none of the expected products 5{15}b or 5{17}b , whereas three other teams using the same reagent combinations ( teams 12 , 13 , 29 and 11 , 12 , 27 ) were successful and had similar results ( 63%  3% and 80%  8% , respectively ) for each of these compounds in the appropriate bill - board positions .",
            "encouraged by the success of the iupui student alkylating agent rehearsal , we tested the ability to further distribute this process to students outside of the united states . using the same procedures",

            "teams at the university of barcelona ( two or three students per bill - board ) evaluated control benzyl bromide ( 6 , six replicates ) and six additional alkylating agents in duplicate ( table 2 ) . with the exclusive use of starting resin purchased from supplier ii , the barcelona laboratories obtained excellent results , providing strong documentation for the ability of distributed discovery to reproducibly synthesize molecules , both within the same site , and around the world .",
            "barcelona , team 3 ) , all the control fmocphe samples 5{6}a were synthesized in > 92% purity as determined by lc / ms ( table 2 ) .",
            "this was consistent with the data generated in the united states at iupui , where the subset of compounds 5{6}a synthesized used starting resin from the same supplier ( ii ) produced 7 of 8 products in > 93% purity ( table 1 ) .",
            "the barcelona laboratories also rehearsed , in duplicate , six new alkylating agents , 2631 .",
            "the data from teams 2 and 3 for 5{28}b indicates that the alkylating agent 28 is also likely to give desired product but with moderate purity .",
            "the methoxy - substituted reagents 29 and 31 illustrate the need for a nuanced interpretation of results .",
            "the crude material recoveries for the methoxy derivatives 5{29}a , b and 5{31}a , b were notably lower compared to the rest of the products in this laboratory . these molecules , as anisole derivatives , are susceptible to friedelcrafts reactions .",
            "it is well established in the peptide field that , in the absence of a powerful cation quenching agent ( such as anisole itself ) , products capable of friedelcrafts reactions can reattach themselves to the resin cation generated in the cleavage process .",
            "accordingly , selective , cleavage - condition dependent removal of desired product ( by reattachment to the resin ) could mask a successful alkylation prior to cleavage . to further demonstrate the ability of the distributed reagent rehearsal project to provide replicated results in student laboratories across the globe ,",
            "table 3 compares a set of molecules prepared at iupui ( united states ) , the university of barcelona ( spain ) , moscow state university ( russia ) , and the lublin school of pharmacy ( poland ) .",
            "these results indicate that d syntheses can be carried out at multiple global locations and afford reproducible results .",
            "the product 5{32}a ( figure 4 ) was obtained in 76% purity ( lc / ms analysis ) .",
            "moscow single - site result . to fully characterize products from the reagent rehearsal and confirm that student - generated results can reliably predict synthetic outcomes ,",
            "all of the listed alkylating agents were subsequently re - evaluated by a postdoctoral fellow at iupui . using resin from source ii ,",
            "the experimental procedure used was identical to that employed in the rehearsal laboratories at iupui .",
            "the results , summarized in table 4 , confirm the ability of student rehearsed chemistry to be replicated by a third party .",
            "these results also resolved the questions arising from the large variability of results in the rehearsal of reagents 28 and 29 reported in table 2 .",
            "in addition , the single result reported by the moscow site for reagent 32 was confirmed .",
            "the supporting information provides lc / ms data for all the crude products from indianapolis , lublin , and moscow , along with nmr data for all the purified , new compounds prepared .",
            "rl = averaged results from student rehearsal laboratories ; pd = result from postdoc synthesis at iupui .",
            "single value , other value was 0% . in summary , these first reagent rehearsal laboratories document a key requirement of the distributed drug discovery concept : the global ability of students to evaluate reagents and reproducibly make new potential drug leads , using simple , inexpensive equipment and procedures . these reagents are now acceptable as input in the enumeration of the d accessible virtual catalogs to be described in part ii .",
            "an essential component of distributed drug discovery is the open - access availability of databases of molecules accessible through distributed chemistry .",
            "computational chemists can then analyze these large databases to identify and make globally available smaller databases of potential drug leads targeted for developing world diseases .",
            "subsequently , the synthesis of the selected molecules can be carried out , in a distributed fashion , at sites across the world . the compounds ( including stereoisomers when appropriate ) in this virtual d catalog were enumerated with commercial software . to ensure that virtual library generation is not limited by cost we also enumerate libraries with alternative software currently available for free to academia .",
            "on the basis of the distributed chemistry developed and reported in this article , two types of library enumeration were envisioned .",
            ", a much larger ,  virtual  d catalog ( including the compounds actually made ) can be enumerated from all combinations of rehearsed or otherwise well - precedented reagents used at the variable alkylation and acylation steps . to illustrate this process , we assembled lists of acceptable , commercially available , alkylating and acylating agents ( tables 5 and 6 , respectively ) to enumerate a representative virtual d catalog of acylated unnatural amino acids ( scheme 2 ) .",
            "for the alkylation step extensive precedence is available , both from our solution- and solid - phase studies and those of others , to predict the reactivity of schiff base esters and related systems with these electrophiles under a variety of basic conditions . for example , even though michael addition reactions were not rehearsed in the present study , we have confidence , based on our earlier solid - phase research using resin - bound schiff bases and michael acceptors as electrophiles , that reactants 93108 ( table 5 ) can be utilized successfully .",
            ", we plan to incorporate all rehearsed reagent information into a single database to further assist reagent selection . in the acylation step",
            "however , we have since modified our d laboratories to use carboxylic acids to form the amides by traditional carbodiimide mediated couplings .",
            "this makes available a much wider repertoire of inexpensive reactants for enumeration at the second variable position .",
            "because the reactivity of carboxylic acids in forming amide bonds is extensively documented , simple chemical intuition and reactivity considerations were used to select the 100 carboxylic acids ( table 6 ) for enumeration .",
            "on the basis of these considerations , a virtual d catalog of 24  416 acylated unnatural amino acids 5 was enumerated . as discussed in the following article , an additional 24  192 methyl esters of these acylated unnatural amino acids",
            "were enumerated on the basis of the cleavage of resin - bound products 4 by methanolysis .",
            "thus , a total of 48  608 unique products are available for d catalog access and searching .",
            "the 100 commercially available alkylating agents and michael acceptors and 100 carboxylic acids used to perform these enumerations are shown in tables 5 and 6 , respectively .",
            "the catalog of acylated unnatural amino acids contains more than the 20  000 members that would arise from a simple 100  100 combinatorial process .",
            "this is caused by the formation of stereoisomers in the alkylation step and their combination with other stereoisomers sometimes present in the alkylating or acylating reagents .",
            "thus , from two to eight stereoisomers appear for each structure in the virtual d catalog .",
            "the separate listing of each of these anticipated stereoisomeric products allows appropriate computational discrimination and selection when three - dimensional modeling software is employed and chirality is important .",
            "two stereoisomers arise when there are no other stereogenic elements in either the electrophile or the acid [ e.g. , ( r)-5{12,207 } plus enantiomer ] or when the electrophile or acid is present as a single enantiomer ( r , r)-5{22,117 } plus diastereomer ] or geometric isomer ( r , e)-5{82,208 } plus enantiomer ] .",
            "four stereoisomers are contained in the library when a racemic or prochiral electrophile or a racemic carboxylic acid is used ( s , s)-5{18,121 } or ( r)-5{93,159 } plus three other stereoisomers for each ] .",
            "eight stereoisomers arise when both a racemic electrophile and a racemic carboxylic acid are used ( r , r , r)-5{47,186 } plus seven other stereoisomers ] .",
            "the synthesis of stereoisomeric mixtures of unnatural amino acid derivatives has the advantage of providing stereoisomers for evaluation .",
            "the follow up work to identify the active stereoisomer can be accomplished , without stereoselective synthesis , through bioassay guided fractionation or chiral chromatography .",
            "the active stereoisomer identified by these techniques can be subsequently prepared by known stereoselective synthetic routes , separation techniques , or resolution procedures .",
            "it is important to consider potential side - reactions during the various steps of the synthesis of acylated unnatural amino acids 5 .",
            "for example , the tert - butyl esters present in resin - bound products 4 that originated in the reactants used for alkylation , michael addition , or acylation ( 36 , 75 , 96 ) will be converted to the carboxylic acids during tfa cleavage .",
            "likewise , the t - butyl carbamate ( n - boc ) group in reactant 83 will be cleaved to the free indole nh on tfa cleavage to products 5 . a lead reference for each of these subsequent reactions is noted with the respective reactant , and this is reflected in the enumerated product structures .",
            "other more subtle side reactions will be incorporated into the enumeration products as they are discovered on the basis of literature precedence or rehearsal of reagents by our group or by others . to illustrate the variety of virtual molecules available through this enumeration",
            "the open - access availability of this virtual d catalog makes possible the global computational selection of candidates for drug synthesis , while simultaneously enabling the prioritization of future reagent rehearsals . when computational analysis suggests a particular library member may be a drug lead for a developing world disease target , that molecule will be selected for distributed synthesis .",
            "if the reagent used as input in its enumeration is unrehearsed , the synthesis will evaluate its suitability as a reagent and enable it to become a part of this expanding rehearsed reagent database , stored electronically and available through open - access .",
            "students carry out , using simple procedures and inexpensive equipment , worldwide replicated solid - phase combinatorial chemistry , rehearsing new reagents and generating new compounds for library production . at the same time they learn and develop important synthetic skills and methodologies .",

            "moreover , the results of the present study suggest that the italian version of the brian shows an interesting discriminant validity in screening for bipolar disorder .",
            "the high discriminant validity allows the obtaining of an excellent performance using the brian as a screening tool at the cutoff of 20 . from this perspective",
            ", we must consider that a screener can really be useful if it does not generate false positives and thus is capable of producing a high predictive value of a negative .",
            "in fact , if the test is inexpensive , noninvasive and easy to apply , it can lead to a second evaluation only on positives with a more accurate diagnostic tool , or if another screener is available , one that is equally inexpensive and easy to apply but with complementary performance ( with high sensitivity and low specificity ) , they can be administered simultaneously .",
            "we must therefore take into account that the predictive value of negative evidence we found at a cutoff of 20 is noteworthy .",
            "it is to be underscored that the brian was not conceived or initially tested as a screening tool , but even then it showed acceptable screening properties .  ",
            "the results are of interest because of the well - known difficulties in research in developing accurate screeners for bipolar disorder due to the several existing biases which include memory biases , perception of hypomania as a non - pathological state and others .",
            "in particular , current screening tools show good sensitivity but low specificity . from this point of view",
            "the brian could be highly complementary to questionnaires such as the mood disorder questionnaire ( mdq ) and hypomania checklist-32 ( hcl-32 ) and its use associated with a clinical questionnaire ( more sensitive but less specific ) could make the screening very effective . in all cases the result was so good as to suggest extending the possibility of using a scale of biological rhythms as screening for bipolar disorder or introducing some items on biological rhythms into well - known clinical screeners such as the mdq   or hcl-32 . from this point of view",
            "we must consider that this study was conducted by comparing patients with bipolar disorder to people without psychiatric diagnoses . in practice",
            ", a screening tool should be able to discriminate especially among people with different pathologies . from this perspective",
            "it must be considered that the disturbances of biological rhythms have recently been reported not only in bipolar disorders but also in other psychiatric disorders such as major depression , stress related disorders , autism and schizophrenia [ 21 - 24 ] .",
            "however , it has been highlighted in recent literature that the weight of the dysregulation of biological rhythms in bipolar disorder is higher than in other disorders and can be described as a kind of characteristic of these disorders   .",
            "even on the level of genetic determinants a justification for the association between dysregulation of biological rhythms and bipolar syndromes has been found .",
            "if it is thus evident that the screening of biological rhythm dysregulation can divide people with bipolar disorder from people without a psychiatric diagnosis , it follows that this can occur during a screening of the general population .",
            "however , the extent of biological rhythm dysregulation has never been introduced as a possible screening tool at the speculative level . in the light of these psychometric results",
            "it would be interesting to design a tool that that combines the features of mixed measurement of hyperactivity and hyperergia typical of most known screens , such as the mdq and hcl , with the measurement of biological rhythms .",

            "therefore , the decrease in sleep has been identified as a predictor of manic episodes .",
            "psychoeducational programs have shown that preventing disruptions in the circadian sleep cycle is important in maintaining a regular sleep schedule .",
            "amongst the limitations we must consider the preliminary nature of the data , the limited sample size and the fact that the current study was designed to validate the italian version of the brian , not to test its screening properties .",

            "the kd is comprised of four elements , the changes of any of them can potentially lead to losing its anticonvulsant effect : ( 1 ) increased amount of fat , usually in a ratio of 3 to 4 grams of fat for each gram of protein and carbohydrates , ( 2 ) as low a consumption of glucose as possible , ( 3 ) caloric restriction , and ( 4 ) fluid restriction .",
            "although there is some debate about the last component , clinical practice has shown that stopping fluid restriction can lead to seizure recurrence much in the same way as when stopping glucose restriction .  ",
            "the most important result of observing the diet is the increased blood level of free fatty acids ( ffas ) .",
            "the ffas are transferred into the mitochondria , a process which requires the presence of an appropriate amount of carnitine , where they are degraded into ketone bodies through  oxidation .",
            "these ketone bodies include  hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate , and acetone   ( figure 1 ) .  ",
            "the effect of the increased amount of ketone bodies seems to be the most prominent of all other suggested antiepileptic mechanisms of the kd .",
            "the degradation of the ketone bodies delivers acetyl - coa directly to the tricarboxylic acid cycle , thus increasing its turnover while bypassing the need to depend on acetyl - coa coming from glycolysis to produce atp . unlike glucose , which requires a transporter to cross the blood brain barrier ,",

            "another product of an elevated level of free fatty acids is polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) .",
            "the potential ability of pufas to block seizure activity in the brain is speculated to be associated with some rather more complicated mechanisms , including ( 1 ) directly inhibiting voltage - gated sodium and calcium channels , ( 2 ) activating a lipid - sensitive potassium channel , ( 3 ) enhancing the activity of the sodium pump to limit neuronal excitability , ( 4 ) activating peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor- ( ppar ) , and ( 5 ) inducing the expression and activity of brain - specific uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria , thereby inducing a neuroprotective effect .",

            "this , in turn , drives the formation of atp from adenosine phosphate ( adp ) by atp synthase .",
            "enhanced atp can either be converted to phosphocreatine for energy storage or broken into adenosine .",
            "enhanced atp levels provide energy reserves for a neuron to continue functioning under stress . increased extracellular adenosine offers a neuroprotective buffer against insults , reduces excitation , and averts excessive atp demands , thus providing local seizure control and neuroprotection .  ",

            "the database contains data on regulons - sets of genes in transcription units whose expression is regulated by the same regulatory proteins - with different types of evidence and different levels of description .",

            "the data for 26 of the regulatory proteins includes information on at least three regulated genes , with at least one binding site per gene ( table 1 ) .",
            "as explained below , we distinguish between pattern discovery and pattern search and evaluate each separately .",
            "one is dyad - analysis , a program developed to find over - represented small words separated by a given distance .",

            "the evaluations take into account the interest in minimizing the false - positive rate , as even a very small false - positive rate can overshadow true positives because of the small number of genes expected to be part of each regulon ( see below ) . as most regulatory sites for dna - binding proteins",
            "are found 200 to 400 base - pairs ( bp ) upstream of the regulated genes , we built two sets of upstream regions .",
            "one contained 200 bp of the region upstream of the genes ' start sites plus 50 bp downstream ( 200 + 50 set ) ; the other contained 400 bp upstream plus 50 bp downstream of the start sites ( 400 + 50 set ) .",

            "another factor that influences the size of region to analyze is whether the precise site of transcription initiation ( the + 1 position ) is known . when the promoter is known , the search can be limited to 200 bp upstream from the + 1 position .",

            "repressor sites are located near the promoter site , whereas activators tend to occupy a larger region upstream of the promoter .",
            "it is therefore potentially useful to evaluate the performance of the methods with these two different ranges of sequence .",
            "additional information can also influence the decision of the experimentalist to select the length of upstream region to analyze .",
            "for instance , some proteins tend to have a single binding site per promoter , which has to be proximal to the promoter ( for example lexa ) , whereas other proteins tend to have several binding sites per upstream region , with some of them farther upstream of the promoter ( for example arac , lrp and metj ) .",
            "another factor that influences the size of region to analyze is whether the precise site of transcription initiation ( the + 1 position ) is known . when the promoter is known , the search can be limited to 200 bp upstream from the + 1 position .",
            "if it is not known , then the reference point has to be the start codon and the 400 bp upstream of this are used - which assumes an average of 50 to 100 bp between the promoter and the beginning of the gene .",
            "we used the total set of upstream regions containing at least one reported binding site in regulondb as the basic data for evaluation . in each case , upstream regions of genes regulated by the same protein ( regulons ) were separated from the collection and constituted the ' training sets ' . for each set ,",
            "the remaining upstream regions , known to be regulated by other proteins , are assumed to be the collection of ' known negatives ' .",
            "though there is still a risk that the known negatives contain genes that also pertain to the regulon we are contrasting them with , the fact that they have been the subject of experimental work allows us to think that this risk is minute .",
            "because of the small amount of data for each protein , we could not leave out a set of known positives to evaluate the rate of true positives , except in the case of the regulatory protein crp .",
            "for those families having at least five upstream regions we were able to apply a ' leave one out ' procedure as described below .",
            "we also have information , in some cases , on genes regulated by a given protein in the regulons analyzed , but with no reported binding site .",
            "the upstream regions of these genes were used to search for binding sites and provide further evaluation .",
            "a more detailed analysis was performed for lexa , comparing our predictions with a recent report in the literature .",
            "depending on the information available , there are basically two computational approaches to predicting binding sites for transcription initiation factors in dna . in the best cases , there is information on experimentally determined examples of binding sites for a given regulatory protein . in such cases ,",
            "the search programs can be trained using the sequences corresponding to the binding sites , and the information obtained ( dyads , weight matrices ) can then be used to find similar sequences , and thus other genes that might be under the control of the same regulatory protein .",
            "is that a set of apparently co - regulated genes is identified from transcriptome experiments . in this case ,",
            "a program would be trained with a collection of upstream regions from these genes with the goal of identifying probable shared regulatory sites .",
            "if the data come from transcriptome experiments , the collection of co - regulated genes might not be complete .",
            "because of the noise inherent to such experiments , and/or to the limitations of clustering algorithms , a researcher might wish to try to find other genes likely to be under the control of the same protein . however",
            ", other genes regulated by the same protein might display a different pattern of expression as a result of complications such as regulation by more than one regulatory protein . on the basis of these considerations ,",
            "the analyses we present contemplate the use of experimentally determined binding sites as training sets to study pattern search , and the use of upstream regions of co - regulated genes to study pattern discovery .",
            "more precisely , we use the set of binding sites in dna for each regulatory protein reported in regulondb to try to find additional genes in the genome with similar sites .",
            "we also use the data on known co - regulated genes to try to find the binding site within the genes ' upstream regions . as training sets",
            ", we ran the dyad or matrix search programs on the sequences of known regulatory binding sites and on upstream regions of 200 + 50 and 400 + 50 bp from genes regulated by a given regulatory protein .",
            "families corresponding to a given regulatory protein were evaluated only if there were at least three sequences in the corresponding training set ( 40 in the collection of binding sites ; 26 in the 200 + 50 and the 400 + 50 datasets ) .",
            "subsequently , the dyads and matrices were evaluated against the complete collections of 200 + 50 and 400 + 50 upstream regions .",
            "this gives a total of 3  2 = 6 evaluations for each regulon analyzed .",
            "the evaluations included regions 200 + 50 or 400 + 50 only if there was at least one reported binding site within that range ; thus , the total set of 200 + 50 regions contained 172 sequences , and the 400 + 50 set contained 189 .",
            "we used the dyad - analysis program   to find dyads within each training set .",
            "the options used were to find dyads of 3 bp long separated by distances of 0 to 16 bp , with any kind of dyad ( direct repeat , inverted repeat , asymmetric ) , searching in both dna strands .",
            "further analyses were limited to the training sets where the program found at least one dyad with a significance equal to or above 1.0 ( see   for a detailed description of significance ) .",
            "this left 19 families from the binding - sites training sets , 11 from the 200 + 50 regions , and 14 from the 400 + 50 regions ( the program dyad - analysis did not find any dyad in about 75% of the rejected families , and found just one in most of the rest of them ) .",
            "the program consensus was run to obtain alignments and matrices 20 bp long - the most frequent size among binding sites for regulatory proteins . to assign match scores",
            ", we used an ' alphabet ' based on the frequency of each base at upstream regions of 200 + 50 and 400 + 50 of all genes in e. coli .",
            "the search was done in a single strand . although we also ran the program to find symmetric patterns , no clear improvement was observed . in the results section ,",
            "we first present results of pattern discovery , then concentrate on the selection of the best thresholds , analyzing their performance on the basis of the evaluation criteria described above . finally , we present some specific predictions .",
            "pattern discovery starts with a collection of co - regulated genes for which no binding sites are yet known . to evaluate the methodology",
            ", we counted the number of times a sensor can locate a known binding site in a collection of 200 + 50 or 400 + 50 regions .",
            "over - represented words would be expected to occur at the binding sites , and thus the first step was to determine if the resulting dyads match the binding sites .",
            "we found that there are significant dyads all along the sequences analyzed , with most of them matching at or near the known binding sites .",
            "figure 1 shows , using the purr family , that most dyads were found at distances very close to or overlapping the true binding sites .",
            "we thus decided to search for stretches of contiguous matches , which we call ' regions of overlapping matches ' ( roms ) , in the upstream sequences being analyzed by counting ( sweeping ) , base by base , the number of matching dyads .",
            "as seen in figure 2 , the roms with the highest number of matching dyads overlap the true known binding sites in the dna .",
            "this result motivated us to use the highest number of matches within a rom as the score .",
            "we call this method dyad sweeping . as the highest - scoring roms frequently overlap reported binding sites ( figure 2 , table 2 ) , we decided to keep , for subsequent analyses , the dyads found within the highest - scoring roms of each upstream region , as long as the rom contained at least two dyads . in table 3",
            "it can be seen that , except in a few of the regulons , the fraction of regions with known binding sites found is quite high . in other words ,",
            "the set of dyads that result after keeping only those that contribute to the highest rom in each family is able to recover a large fraction of all the known binding sites in the family .",
            "it is important to keep in mind that a given dyad can match several positions - and therefore sites - in a single region or family .",
            "thus , selecting only those dyads appearing in the highest peak does not restrict their ability to find more than one site per region .",
            "the number of dyads that describe the set of known binding sites in a given regulatory family is quite variable .",
            "for instance , if we use the known binding sites as training sets , the tyrr family involves 14 different dyads whereas arca has 65 .",
            "there is no clear correlation between the number of dyads per site and the total number of sites in the training set for any given family , or any other property of the regulatory site , such as its size .",

            "the searching method based on the results of consensus is already available ; the weight matrix generated can be used to search , with the companion program patser , for sites in other upstream regions .",
            "the search using patser was made using the first matrix ( highest informational content ) obtained in the final cycle of consensus .",
            "this cycle requires all regions to contribute at least one sequence to the matrix . using patser",

            "dyad sweeping finds on average more than 70% of the binding sites ( when dyad - analysis obtains significant dyads ) as compared to around 60% with patser .",
            "note that using shorter regions to search for dna binding sites ( 200 + 50 ) , improves the performance of both methods by about 5 - 7% .",

            "a region is considered found when at least one site in that region is found .",
            "therefore , the results differ from those in table 4 because of the occurrence of multiple sites in some upstream regions .",
            "a clear case of this is the argr regulon , where each of the six regions has two binding sites .",
            "the methods detect from 17% to 58% of the sites , but find from 33 to 100% of the regions .",
            "detection of new members of regulons requires the selection of an optimal threshold to accept a sequence as a predicted binding site , and the genes downstream of such sequences as new members of the regulon family .",
            "the selection of the best threshold requires the evaluation of the following parameters : sensitivity ( rate of true positives ) , specificity ( rate of true negatives ) , accuracy ( overall rate of true results ) , and , very important in this case , the positive predictive value ( rate of true positives among the total number of positives , true and false ) .",
            "we used a leave one out ( loo ) procedure to evaluate the true - positive and false - negative rates with families containing at least five reported genes with binding sites .",
            "the loo method consists of leaving one gene at a time out of the training set ; then , with the matrix or dyads built with the remaining sites , a search is made for a probable binding site within the upstream region of the gene that was left out .",
            "we combined the results of the left - out regions to build the total set of known positives for evaluation of true positives and false negatives .",
            "the evaluation of true negatives and false positives was carried out using the whole set of known positives as training sets and all the remaining regions known to be regulated by any other protein , as known negatives . instead of calculating an average of the scores , and defining the threshold on the basis of standard deviations , we scanned the scores scale form the minimum score obtained in the collection of positive , to the maximum one , calculating the evaluation parameters noted above at each point of the scale .",
            "there is no point in searching at lower scores as there is no effect on sensitivity at such values . in figure 3",
            "we show the results of the analyses of the purr regulon using dyad sweeping . here , the minimum number of matches evaluated was one .",
            "note that , as the dataset of known negatives exceeds that of known positives , high accuracy coexists with a large number of true negatives . nevertheless , at the threshold of 10 matches , despite a very low false - positive value ( less than 10% ) , and a very high accuracy ( approximately 95% ) and sensitivity ( 90% )",
            ", the positive predictive value ( ppv ) shows that the total true positives in the whole ' predicted ' set is about 60% .",
            "as most regulatory proteins regulate just a few genes in comparison with the whole set of genes in a given organism , such a difference means that false positives might dilute reliable predictions even at very low false - positive rates .",
            "the ppv alone would leave results with very little recovery of true binding sites . therefore , calculating an optimal point for prediction requires the use of a balanced evaluation criterion .",
            "after examining several graphs , we noticed that the average between accuracy and ppv ( which we call the overall performance or op ) would be a good criterion .",
            "this makes sense , as op represents a trade - off between those two statistical measures .",
            "other criteria , such as the product of accuracy and ppv , might be used instead , but op worked well for our purposes . in a few cases ,",
            "the point of highest op leaves a very small sensitivity value ( around 50% in purr , for instance ) .",
            "if the sensitivity value was less than 60% , we used the last point where the sensitivity was above 60% . in figure 4",
            "we show the results of sensitivity and false - positive rate for all regulons at their best op value using dyad sweeping .",
            "the use of weight matrices derived from consensus ( with patser ) is not illustrated , as the selection of the best threshold is the same as in dyad sweeping . in figure 5",
            "we show the results of sensitivity and false - positive rates of each regulon at the best overall performance point of each regulon analyzed using patser . in table 6",
            "we give the fraction of sites found per family in regions of 400 + 50 bp when starting from different training sets using the threshold chosen as described above .",
            "dyad - detection / sweeping still performs better at finding the sites within an upstream region , while consensus / patser trained with binding sites finds the sites at an average of almost 77% .",
            "an interesting finding here was that , when trained with all the upstream 400 + 50 sequences , consensus finds an alignment and matrix that clearly discriminates between the sequences used in the training set , or regulon , from any other upstream sequence in e. coli .",
            "however , in some families , the matrix matches at sites different from the experimentally determined dna binding site of the regulon under analysis ( figure 6 ) , and such sites do not correspond to any known site , motif or region annotated in regulondb in the upstream sequence .",
            "we also verified that they do not match conserved regions in between pairs of sites .",
            "it will be indeed interesting to find out if these sequences have any biological meaning .",
            "once the optimal threshold was obtained , we proceeded to predict other members of each regulon using the complete collection of upstream regions ( 200 + 50 and 400 + 50 ) of the e. coli genome . in order to further evaluate the predictions",
            "obtained , we used the recent annotations of cellular functions assigned by monica riley and her group to known e. coli genes .",
            "about 30% of the genes in e. coli have no function assigned , and each gene or gene product can be assigned to more than a single cellular role . in table 7",
            "we show the consistency between the functional annotations of genes experimentally demonstrated to belong to each regulon as compared with the functional annotations of the set of predicted genes .",
            "in the cases of predictions of high confidence ( for example , argr , crp and purr - all with correspondences above 90% ) , a putative function can be reliably assigned to genes of unknown function .",
            "for instance , in the case of the purr family , the genes without functional annotations might be assigned to macromolecule ( dna / rna ) biosynthesis .",
            "this is an example of functional gene prediction based on analysis of its regulatory elements .",
            "annotations like ' active transporter ' would require other kinds of evidence ( see additional data files ) .",
            "functional annotations might be quite helpful in cleaning up wrong predictions , or adjusting the proposed thresholds , although limited by the genomic coverage of the functional assignments .",
            "regulondb contains information on a few genes belonging to some of the regulons studied but with no mapped binding site for the relevant regulatory protein .",
            "as further evaluation , we show the results of dyad sweeping and patser , trained with the known binding sites of each regulon , for all of these genes ( tables 8,9 ) . in the tables we indicate whether the gene would be included in the corresponding predictions , the highest scoring rom ( dyad sweeping , table 8) or pattern match ( patser , table 9 ) found in the 400 + 50 region of the gene , and the actual sequence suggested as part of the possible binding site .",
            "some genes would be rejected as predictions , but the small amount of data makes it impossible to appropriately evaluate this problem . a researcher might choose to use a different , perhaps lower , threshold if the intention is to find every gene for a given regulon experimentally , and such a decision would depend on how many confirmatory experiments it is possible to perform ( an example is shown in the next section ) .",
            "lower thresholds can also be used if the intention is to confirm new members suggested by other data , like clustering of a gene or genes with known members of a regulon .",
            "the latter case is exemplified by the results with those regulon members lacking a mapped binding site .",
            "most contain roms or patterns scoring above the minimal score obtained for a known member of the regulon ( no search is performed below this lower limit ) , often just below our suggested threshold .",
            "thus , if there is additional evidence that a gene belongs to a given regulon , the roms found can be proposed as the putative binding sites .",
            "a recent attempt has been made by fernandez de henestrosa et al . to locate all the members of the lexa regulon by a combined strategy that included prediction of probable binding sites and experimental confirmation .",
            "experimental confirmation showed that only 10 of the 49 predicted new members responded to lexa .",
            "the authors also give a table of previously found members of the lexa regulon , which includes a few genes not annotated in regulondb .",
            "we could analyze only five of their experimentally confirmed genes and 31 of their wrong predictions ( predictions they later found experimentally not to be regulated by lexa ) because of the lack of updating of the e. coli k12 genome annotations . in table 10",

            "detection of new members of regulons requires the selection of an optimal threshold to accept a sequence as a predicted binding site , and the genes downstream of such sequences as new members of the regulon family .",
            "the selection of the best threshold requires the evaluation of the following parameters : sensitivity ( rate of true positives ) , specificity ( rate of true negatives ) , accuracy ( overall rate of true results ) , and , very important in this case , the positive predictive value ( rate of true positives among the total number of positives , true and false ) . definitions of these terms are given in the legend to table 5 . we used a",
            "leave one out ( loo ) procedure to evaluate the true - positive and false - negative rates with families containing at least five reported genes with binding sites .",
            "the loo method consists of leaving one gene at a time out of the training set ; then , with the matrix or dyads built with the remaining sites , a search is made for a probable binding site within the upstream region of the gene that was left out .",
            "we combined the results of the left - out regions to build the total set of known positives for evaluation of true positives and false negatives .",
            "the evaluation of true negatives and false positives was carried out using the whole set of known positives as training sets and all the remaining regions known to be regulated by any other protein , as known negatives . instead of calculating an average of the scores , and defining the threshold on the basis of standard deviations",
            ", we scanned the scores scale form the minimum score obtained in the collection of positive , to the maximum one , calculating the evaluation parameters noted above at each point of the scale .",
            "there is no point in searching at lower scores as there is no effect on sensitivity at such values . in figure 3",
            "we show the results of the analyses of the purr regulon using dyad sweeping . here , the minimum number of matches evaluated was one .",
            "note that , as the dataset of known negatives exceeds that of known positives , high accuracy coexists with a large number of true negatives . nevertheless , at the threshold of 10 matches , despite a very low false - positive value ( less than 10% ) , and a very high accuracy ( approximately 95% ) and sensitivity ( 90% ) , the positive predictive value ( ppv ) shows that the total true positives in the whole ' predicted ' set is about 60% .",
            "as most regulatory proteins regulate just a few genes in comparison with the whole set of genes in a given organism , such a difference means that false positives might dilute reliable predictions even at very low false - positive rates .",
            "the ppv alone would leave results with very little recovery of true binding sites . therefore , calculating an optimal point for prediction requires the use of a balanced evaluation criterion .",
            "after examining several graphs , we noticed that the average between accuracy and ppv ( which we call the overall performance or op ) would be a good criterion .",
            "this makes sense , as op represents a trade - off between those two statistical measures .",
            "other criteria , such as the product of accuracy and ppv , might be used instead , but op worked well for our purposes . in a few cases ,",
            "the point of highest op leaves a very small sensitivity value ( around 50% in purr , for instance ) .",
            "if the sensitivity value was less than 60% , we used the last point where the sensitivity was above 60% . in figure 4",
            "we show the results of sensitivity and false - positive rate for all regulons at their best op value using dyad sweeping .",
            "the use of weight matrices derived from consensus ( with patser ) is not illustrated , as the selection of the best threshold is the same as in dyad sweeping . in figure 5",
            "we show the results of sensitivity and false - positive rates of each regulon at the best overall performance point of each regulon analyzed using patser . in table 6",
            "we give the fraction of sites found per family in regions of 400 + 50 bp when starting from different training sets using the threshold chosen as described above .",
            "dyad - detection / sweeping still performs better at finding the sites within an upstream region , while consensus / patser trained with binding sites finds the sites at an average of almost 77% .",
            "an interesting finding here was that , when trained with all the upstream 400 + 50 sequences , consensus finds an alignment and matrix that clearly discriminates between the sequences used in the training set , or regulon , from any other upstream sequence in e. coli .",
            "however , in some families , the matrix matches at sites different from the experimentally determined dna binding site of the regulon under analysis ( figure 6 ) , and such sites do not correspond to any known site , motif or region annotated in regulondb in the upstream sequence .",
            "we also verified that they do not match conserved regions in between pairs of sites .",
            "it will be indeed interesting to find out if these sequences have any biological meaning .",
            "once the optimal threshold was obtained , we proceeded to predict other members of each regulon using the complete collection of upstream regions ( 200 + 50 and 400 + 50 ) of the e. coli genome . in order to further evaluate the predictions",
            "obtained , we used the recent annotations of cellular functions assigned by monica riley and her group to known e. coli genes .",
            "about 30% of the genes in e. coli have no function assigned , and each gene or gene product can be assigned to more than a single cellular role . in table 7",
            "we show the consistency between the functional annotations of genes experimentally demonstrated to belong to each regulon as compared with the functional annotations of the set of predicted genes . in the cases of predictions of high confidence ( for example , argr , crp and purr - all with correspondences above 90% )",
            "for instance , in the case of the purr family , the genes without functional annotations might be assigned to macromolecule ( dna / rna ) biosynthesis .",
            "this is an example of functional gene prediction based on analysis of its regulatory elements .",
            "annotations like ' active transporter ' would require other kinds of evidence ( see additional data files ) .",
            "functional annotations might be quite helpful in cleaning up wrong predictions , or adjusting the proposed thresholds , although limited by the genomic coverage of the functional assignments .",
            "regulondb contains information on a few genes belonging to some of the regulons studied but with no mapped binding site for the relevant regulatory protein . as further evaluation",
            ", we show the results of dyad sweeping and patser , trained with the known binding sites of each regulon , for all of these genes ( tables 8,9 ) . in the tables we indicate whether the gene would be included in the corresponding predictions , the highest scoring rom ( dyad sweeping , table 8) or pattern match ( patser , table 9 ) found in the 400 + 50 region of the gene , and the actual sequence suggested as part of the possible binding site .",
            "some genes would be rejected as predictions , but the small amount of data makes it impossible to appropriately evaluate this problem . a researcher might choose to use a different , perhaps lower , threshold if the intention is to find every gene for a given regulon experimentally , and such a decision would depend on how many confirmatory experiments it is possible to perform ( an example is shown in the next section ) .",
            "lower thresholds can also be used if the intention is to confirm new members suggested by other data , like clustering of a gene or genes with known members of a regulon .",
            "the latter case is exemplified by the results with those regulon members lacking a mapped binding site .",
            "most contain roms or patterns scoring above the minimal score obtained for a known member of the regulon ( no search is performed below this lower limit ) , often just below our suggested threshold .",
            "thus , if there is additional evidence that a gene belongs to a given regulon , the roms found can be proposed as the putative binding sites .",
            "a recent attempt has been made by fernandez de henestrosa et al . to locate all the members of the lexa regulon by a combined strategy that included prediction of probable binding sites and experimental confirmation .",
            "experimental confirmation showed that only 10 of the 49 predicted new members responded to lexa .",
            "the authors also give a table of previously found members of the lexa regulon , which includes a few genes not annotated in regulondb .",
            "we could analyze only five of their experimentally confirmed genes and 31 of their wrong predictions ( predictions they later found experimentally not to be regulated by lexa ) because of the lack of updating of the e. coli k12 genome annotations . in table 10",

            "we show our results with their wrong predictions . using dyad sweeping , we find 20 out of the 23 confirmed members of the lexa regulon , whereas we would reject 20 out of their 31 wrong predictions . with consensus",
            ", we detect 18 of the 23 confirmed members of the regulon , while rejecting 19 of their wrong predictions .",
            "stringent evaluations of pattern discovery and pattern searching methods should be carried out to establish the confidence of a given prediction . here",
            "we take advantage of the availability of reasonable negative samples - all other known regulons described in regulondb , except the one under study - in order to use standard statistical measurements of performance such as specificity and ppv .",
            "the ppv allowed us to stress how important even low rates of false positives might become in a large population .",
            "the small proportion of genes expected to be regulated by a given regulatory protein makes it important to emphasize the need for a stringent threshold to admit new members of regulons , as the true positives might be diluted in a high number of false positives .",
            "nevertheless , if additional independent evidence is available , thresholds can be relaxed to include as many predictions as the confirmation procedure ( genetic evidence of the regulatory effect , for instance ) would allow .",
            "for instance , if the two computational methods were combined , only one of the genes known to be regulated by lexa ( see previous section ) would be rejected by both methods ( ybfe in table 10 ) , while 16 of the wrong predictions are rejected by both methods ( table 11 ) . a very striking observation that deserves experimental analysis",
            "the program discovers patterns that discriminate , very specifically , the upstream regions used as training sets from the other regions .",
            "these results imply the existence of new sequence elements specific to each family , different from those reported in the literature . we have not yet found ( data not shown ) any additional property that could suggest their function ; their distance from the start site of transcription to known binding sites is not conserved ;",
            "in some cases the predicted motif occurs upstream of the known sites in some promoters and downstream in other promoters .",
            "we have , of course , verified these observations twice , and find no additional property to associate with such families .",
            "in the comparison of the two methods we have not found that one of them performs better in all the evaluations and scenarios considered ( pattern search , pattern abstraction and pattern discovery ) .",
            "this implies that one could consider combining the different methods to make the best use of their respective strengths .",
            "for instance , if there is evidence of co - regulation only , we would suggest using dyad - analysis / sweeping first to find the binding sites . if dyad - analysis finds significant dyads , the dyad sweeping methodology can be used to extract possible binding sites .",
            "after that , the predicted sites can be used to train consensus and search for further co - regulated genes . in cases where the dna binding sites are known ,",
            "consensus / patser , which are both very fast and simple to use , can give very reliable results in a short time .",
            "the combination of computationally more confident predictions , together with additional independent evidence - for example , functional classes or operon organization - is an intelligent strategy for making more robust predictions .",
            "these more robust upstream regulatory analyses can be used to assign function to unknown genes , as illustrated here with the argr , crp and purr regulons .",
            "one can envisage highly relevant genomic applications of these predictions , such as distinguishing orthologs within families of paralogous genes , based on their differential regulation , or identifying non - orthologous gene displacement on the basis of regulatory comparisons .",
            "the goal in computational biology is twofold : to provide , on the one hand , methods that generate useful and evaluated predictions , and , on the other hand , to use such methods as models of the biology under study .",
            "this latter virtue could generate new ways of understanding fundamental processes in gene regulation , along with , as suggested here , new properties of gene regulation at the genomic level .",
            "each algorithm should be tested on well - defined problems in order to find their strengths .",

            "the targeting of rab17 to the dendrites is neuronal differentiation stage - dependent : at an early stage ( 3 d of in vitro culture ) it localizes only in the cell body , whereas at a later stage ( 11 d of in vitro culture ) some of the rab17 is translocated from the cell body to the dendrites .",
            "by contrast , other rab isoforms are targeted to the axon alone ( e.g. , rab3a ) or to both the axon and dendrites ( e.g. , rab5a ) .",
            "targeting of rab17 to the dendrites is known to be crucial for dendrite morphogenesis and subsequent postsynapse formation , because knockdown of rab17 has been found to result in a marked reduction in both total dendrite length and the number of dendrite branches without affecting axon morphogenesis ( i.e. , total axon length and the number of axon branches ) .",
            "although several mammalian rab isoforms ( e.g. , rab7 and rab11 ) have been shown to regulate dendrite morphogenesis , rab17 is the first reported rab isoform that specifically regulates dendrite morphogenesis , but not axon morphogenesis , in mammalian neurons .",
            "we therefore thought that rab17 would be an ideal rab isoform to use to analyze a rab targeting mechanism at the cellular level .",
            "however , until recently the molecular basis of the specific rab17 targeting to dendrites had completely remained unknown and no physiological rab17-gefs that function in hippocampal neurons had been identified . in our latest study , we screened for rab17-gefs by performing yeast two - hybrid assays with a constitutive negative mutant of rab17 as bait and succeeded in identifying rabex-5 and als2 , both of which were originally described as rab5-gefs , as plausible candidate rab17-gefs in mouse hippocampal neurons .",
            "it is noteworthy that overexpression of rabex-5 , but not of als2 , increased the proportion of rab17 in the dendrites , whereas knockdown of rabex-5 caused a dramatic reduction in the proportion of rab17 in the dendrites .",

            "alignment - based approaches are particularly useful for highly conserved protein - coding genes and , to a lesser extent , short genes encoding housekeeping or regulatory rnas ( e.g. snrnas , snorna , transfer rna ) .",
            "however , these approaches can not immediately apply to all the novel transcripts because of several intrinsic limitations .",
            "first , most newly discovered transcripts are lncrnas , which tend to be lineage specific and less conserved ( 5,6 ) .",
            "for example , only 29 of 550 lncrnas identified from zebrafish had detectable sequence similarity with putative mammalian orthologs ( 6 ) , and only 993 of 8195 human lncrnas have orthologous transcripts in other species ( 5 ) .",
            "second , considerable fractions of lncrnas are overlapped with either the sense or antisense strand of protein - coding genes .",
            "these lncrnas can not be correctly classified by homology searching because they would have significant matches to protein - coding genes ( 3,8,19 ) .",
            "third , the reliability of alignment - based approaches largely depends on the quality of alignments ( 20 ) .",
            "this is problematic because most widely used multiple - sequence alignment tools use heuristics and do not guarantee optimal alignments .",
            "for instance , cpc and phylocsf took 2 days to evaluate the coding potential of 14 353 lncrnas identified by cabili et al .",
            "this problem is getting more attention as massive - scale rna sequencing is increasingly being performed .",
            "consequently , a more accurate , robust and faster method that does not rely on sequence alignment is needed to distinguish ncrnas , especially lncrnas , from protein - coding genes . here , we present coding - potential assessment tool ( cpat ) , an alignment - free program , which uses logistic regression to distinguish between coding and noncoding transcripts on the basis of four sequence features .",
            "cpat is highly accurate ( 0.967 ) and extremely efficient ( 10 000 times faster than cpc and phylocsf , and 50 times faster than portrait ) .",
            "cpat needs only the sequence or coordinate file as input , and it is straightforward to use .",
            "we expanded the availability of cpat to a larger scientific audience via a web interface , which allows users to submit sequences and receive the prediction results back almost instantaneously ( http://lilab.research.bcm.edu/cpat/index.php ) .",
            "coding - potential prediction is essentially a binary decision problem , which makes logistic regression a suitable approach . as an alignment - free method , all selected features ( predictor variables )",
            "the first feature was the maximum length of the open reading frame ( orf ) .",
            "orf length is one of the most fundamental features used to distinguish ncrna from messenger rna because a long putative orf is unlikely to be observed by random chance in noncoding sequences . despite the simplicity , orf length has high concordance with more sophisticated discrimination methods and remains the primary criterion in almost all coding - potential prediction methods ( 21 ) .",
            "the second feature was orf coverage defined as the ratio of orf to transcript lengths .",
            "this feature also has good classification power , and it is highly complementary to , and independent of , the orf length ( supplementary figures s1 and s3 ) . some large bona fide ncrnas may contain putative long orfs by random chance ( 5 ) , and thus can not be classified correctly by orf length alone .",
            "fortunately , those large ncrnas usually have much lower orf coverage than protein - coding rnas ( figure 1b ) . \n",
            "figure 1.score distribution between coding ( red ) and noncoding ( blue ) transcripts for the four linguistic features selected to build the logistic regression model ; training data set containing 10 000 coding and 10 000 noncoding transcripts were used .",
            "score distribution between coding ( red ) and noncoding ( blue ) transcripts for the four linguistic features selected to build the logistic regression model ; training data set containing 10 000 coding and 10 000 noncoding transcripts were used .",
            "the third feature we used was the fickett testcode score ( termed  fickett score hereafter ) , which is a simple linguistic feature that distinguishes protein - coding rna and ncrna according to the combinational effect of nucleotide composition and codon usage bias ( 22 ) .",
            "briefly , the fickett score is obtained by computing four position values and four composition values ( nucleotide content ) from the dna sequence .",
            "the position value reflects the degree to which each base is favored in one codon position versus another .",
            "for example , position value of a ( apos ) is calculated as follows : \n\n  cpos , gpos and tpos are determined in the same way .",
            "these eight values are then converted into probabilities ( p ) of coding using a lookup table provided in the original article .",
            "each probability is multiplied by a weight ( w ) for the respective base , where the value of w reflects the percentage of time each parameter alone successfully predicts coding or noncoding function for the sequences of known function .",
            "finally , the fickett score is calculated as follows : \n\n  the fickett score is independent of the orf , and when the test region is 200 nt in length ( which includes most lncrna ) , this feature alone can achieve 94% sensitivity and 97% specificity , with ",
            "the fourth feature we used was hexamer usage bias ( termed  hexamer score hereafter ) .",
            "this may be the most discriminating feature because of the dependence between adjacent amino acids in proteins ( 23 ) .",
            "the hexamer score can be computed in numerous ways ; here , we used a log - likelihood ratio to measure differential hexamer usage between coding and noncoding sequences . for a given dna sequence , we calculated the probability of the sequence under the model of coding dna and under the model of noncoding dna , and then we took the logarithm of the ratio of these probabilities as the score of coding potential .",
            "we used f ( hi ) ( i = 0 , 1 ,  , 4095 ) and f ( hi ) ( i = 0 , 1 ,  , 4095 ) to represent in - frame hexamer frequency , calculated from coding and noncoding training data sets ( described below ) , respectively .",
            "for a given hexamer sequence s = h1 , h2 ,  , hm , \n\n  hexamer score determines the relative degree of hexamer usage bias in a particular sequence .",
            "positive values indicate a coding sequence , whereas negative values indicate a noncoding sequence . we build a logistic regression model using these four linguistic features as predictor variables .",
            "a  test was used to evaluate whether our logit model with predictors fits the training data significantly better than the null model , which had only an intercept .",
            "we built a high - confidence training data set to measure the prediction performance of our logit model .",
            "this data set contained 10 000 protein - coding transcripts selected from the refseq database ; all transcripts had high - quality protein sequences annotated by the consensus coding sequence project .",
            "we evaluate the model with a 10-fold cross - validation and measured its sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , precision and area under the curve ( auc ) characteristics .",
            "the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve and precision  recall ( pr ) curve were generated using rocr package ( 24 ) .",
            "we also built a nonparametric two - graph roc curve for selecting the optimal cpat score threshold that maximizes the sensitivity and specificity of cpat while minimizing misclassifications .",

            "although cpc had the highest sensitivity ( 0.99 ) , it suffered from poor specificity ( 0.74 ) .",

            "phylocsf had the least sensitivity ( 0.90 ) and the lowest specificity ( 0.63 ) .",
            "part of the reason for these outcomes is that nonconserved transcripts can not be processed by phylocsf .",

            "cpat s excellent discriminatory power was further demonstrated by the greatest separation between the score distributions of coding and noncoding sequences ( figure 5 ) . unlike cpc , phylocsf and portrait , choosing a smaller cpat score threshold to increase the sensitivity will not sacrifice too much specificity . \n",

            "however , the effects of atypical antipsychotics on gestational weight gain , postpartum weight retention , and gestational diabetes have not been systematically addressed ; although , one study has reported that the use of antipsychotics during pregnancy significantly ( or 1.78 , 95% ci 1.043.01 ) increases the risk of developing gestational diabetes .",
            "in addition to metabolic consequences of antipsychotic medications , there are a number of other risk factors which may explain the increased incidence of diabetes in mentally ill patients including hereditary factors , poverty and poor access to good nutrition , physical inactivity , and antipsychotic medication use ( reviewed in holt et al . , 2004 ) .",
            "these changes in glucose homeostasis may explain , in part , the increased incidence of large for gestational age ( lga ) babies born to women taking atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy as lga is regarded as the most common fetal complication when women have gdm or preexisting diabetes   .",
            "the mechanisms by which atypical antipsychotics can cause maternal obesity and dysglycemia are varied , and the relative contribution of each pathway to an aberrant metabolic state is not completely understood .",
            "atypical antipsychotic - induced weight gain and fat accumulation may be the result of altered food intake ( i.e. , hyperphagia and decreased satiety )   , direct effects of the drug on adipocytes to alter lipogenesis and lipolysis in favour of lipid accumulation   , or effects on peripheral tissues to induce insulin resistance   .",
            "this insulin resistance in combination with increased gluconeogenesis   and impaired insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell   may in turn be responsible for the observed increase in type 2 diabetes with the use of atypical antipsychotics .",
            "however , there is a great deal of heterogeneity amongst the responses evoked by different antipsychotics . indeed , while some evoke insulin release , others such as risperidone , ziprasidone , and quetiapine do not .",
            "the paucity of data using individual antipsychotics makes it difficult to conclude how these drugs induce such heterogeneous responses .",
            "regardless of the mechanism , aberrant maternal glucose control and maternal obesity can have significant implications for the long - term health of both the mother and her child .   there is compelling evidence that obesity in women , whether as a result of prepregnancy obesity , excessive gestational weight gain , and/or postpartum weight retention , is associated with an increased risk for many pregnancy - related health complications such as gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy   . in addition , maternal obesity also considerably increases the risk of fetal complications such as spontaneous abortion , stillbirth , congenital anomalies , neonatal death , and altered fetal growth . indeed , in humans , obesity during pregnancy",
            "is associated with a significantly increased risk of macrosomia ( commonly defined as birth weight 4500  g ( 8  lb 13  oz to 9  lb 15  oz ) ) as well as an increased risk of delivering a low birth weight baby   .",
            "similarly , animal studies have also shown that maternal overweight and obesity results in altered fetal growth with reports of both increased and decreased birth weight   .",
            "therefore , based on the well - documented relationships between maternal obesity / diabetes and altered fetal growth , it is plausible that the altered fetal growth in women taking atypical antipsychotics may be a reflection of antipsychotic - induced changes in maternal metabolic or nutritional status .",
            "in addition to the impact of maternal metabolic status on the pregnancy , atypical antipsychotics may also be transferred across the placenta and directly impact fetal growth . while there is limited evidence quantifying the extent to which these drugs are transferred across the placenta , the work of schenker et al .  ",
            "suggests that somewhere in the range of 514% of a labeled olanzapine can be transferred from maternal to fetal system in 4  h. however , the effects of atypical antipsychotics on fetal growth may be also mediated via altered placental development and/or function ( figure 1 ) .",
            "prospective and retrospective analyses of maternal antipsychotic use and fetal outcomes have provided evidence that the use of atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy can result in dysregulated fetal growth .",
            "the results from these studies are conflicting ; with some studies reporting that maternal use of atypical antipsychotics results in an increased incidence of high birth weight babies relative to the normal population and some studies reporting an increased incidence of low birth weight babies   .",
            "such observations suggest the actions of atypical antipsychotics on fetal growth may be described as a",
            " u  shaped growth curve . understanding the mechanisms driving such complex interrelationships may prove to be difficult , but the most likely place to initiate this search may be placental development and function .",
            "mechanistically , it is known that atypical antipsychotics can act via dopamine d2 or serotonin 5-ht2a receptors .",
            "in addition to their well documented , but rather heterogeneous effects on various regions of the brain , the atypical antipsychotics also affect a number of the other tissues .",
            "recent work from viau and colleagues reports the identification of the 5-ht2a serotonin receptor in human trophoblasts , a lineage of cells which are of central importance to placental development and function .",
            "in other cell types , signaling via the 5-ht2a receptor has been shown to affect cellular differentiation , proliferation , and migration , all of which are central to the function of placental trophoblast cells in the establishment of proper placentation   .",
            "such a relationship becomes more relevant because serotonin is synthesized de novo in human trophoblast cells where it likely serves an important endocrine , paracrine , and autocrine role in regulating placental function .",
            "indeed , treatment of cultured trophoblasts , bewo and jeg-3 cells , with serotonin results in increased aromatase activity ; an effect which may result in altered estrogen biosynthesis .",
            "control of estrogen biosynthesis is important not only for successful implantation of the blastocyst but also for the regulation of leptin expression ( review in ) .",
            "furthermore , the levels of leptin in both maternal and fetal plasma have been associated with the regulation of fetal growth   . taken together",
            ", this evidence raises the possibility that atypical antipsychotics may affect fetal growth through the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis and leptin expression .",
            "dopamine receptors , another target of atypical antipsychotics , are also known to be present in the human placenta , in trophoblast cells .",
            "two subtypes , d1 and d2 receptors , have been localized to the spongiotrophoblasts and giant cells of the junctional zone of rat placenta at gestational days 1216 ( term 2123 days ) .",
            "these cell lineages play important roles in the establishment , development , and maintenance of pregnancy in rodents   . like the serotonin receptor",
            ", d2 receptors have also been linked to important hormone regulatory processes such as the inhibition of basal and hormone stimulated release of human placental lactogen ( hpl ) from trophoblast cells . furthermore , the observation that the pattern of d2 receptor expression varies during the course of a normal pregnancy argues for an important role for dopamine signaling during placental / fetal development   .",
            "while the function of these receptors have not been directly related to altered fetal growth , their presence in the placenta suggests that drugs which target these receptors may have potential regulatory consequences for placental function and fetal development . while compounds such as clozapine also have a relatively high affinity for the dopamine d4 receptor subtype ,   which has been detected in the placenta , the functional role(s ) of these receptors in placenta",
            "there is currently a paucity of data supporting the direct action of atypical antipsychotics on placental function .",
            "however , it is biologically plausible that this class of drugs might impact placental function given the presence of the putative receptors for these drugs on trophoblast cells as discussed above .",
            "moreover , activation of dopamine receptors by other drugs , namely , bromocriptine , has been shown to alter the expression of pit-1 ; a pituitary - specific transcription factor which is synthesized in the rat placenta and is involved in the regulation of rat placental lactogen ( rpl ) gene expression , a hormone known to impact fetal development .",
            "alternatively , atypical antipsychotics may affect placental development and/or function via alterations in oxidative stress in this tissue .",
            "oxidative stress is a term used to describe the imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and the ability of the cell to limit their damage .",
            "there is some evidence that olanzapine and quetiapine may act as antioxidants in cultured peripheral neurons by decreasing oxidative stress associated with an increased accumulation of -amyloid protein   and can even work to reverse the effects of compounds known to increase oxidative stress .",
            "however , the majority of evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotics are associated with increased oxidative stress   .",
            "these , apparently , divergent effects of atypical antipsychotics may once again reflect the paucity of data in this area of research .",
            "systematic investigation of these drugs on both neuronal and uterine systems will be important understanding the effects of these drugs on cellular stress response pathways .",
            "clozapine , olanzapine , and aripiprazole have been found to differentially evoke oxidative stress in different regions of the brain .",
            "for example , chronic treatment ( 28 days ) of rats with clozapine increased oxidative damage in the hippocampus .",
            "olanzapine and aripiprazole actually decreased oxidative damage in the prefrontal cortex , despite the observation that the aripiprazole increased mitochondrial superoxide formation , a radical species known to cause both mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative damage   , in the same tissue .",
            "atypical antipsychotics have also been linked to increased superoxide formation and apoptosis in nave neutrophils . furthermore , clozapine treatment of isolated lymphoblasts increased oxidative damage of a limited group of proteins .",
            "the increased damage of proteins associated with cellular metabolism suggests that the oxidative stress may arise from the mitochondria ; known to be a primary producer of cellular superoxide .",
            "production of free radicals from mitochondrial sources tends to preferentially damage mitochondrial proteins , the majority of which are associated with energy metabolism .",
            "evidence that mitochondria are a target of atypical antipsychotics arises from the observation that the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats exposed to clozapine exhibited altered mrna expression for 14 mitochondrial proteins .",
            "six of these proteins comprise various subunits of the electron transport chain , including complex i as well as complex v ( atp synthase ) .",
            "this is particularly pertinent to oxidative stress since inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibition is known to be associated with increased oxidative stress   . while typical and atypical antipsychotics have both been shown to inhibit mitochondrial complex i activity   , the inhibitory effects of atypical antipsychotics generally require higher concentrations",
            ". there are only minimal inhibitory effects of antipsychotics reported on complex ii of the mitochondria   .",
            "in addition , activation of the 5-ht2a receptor has also been associated with mitochondrial biogenesis . taken together ,",
            "it is feasible to propose that some of the actions of the atypical antipsychotics may occur via mitochondrially generated oxidative stress in the placenta especially since the placenta is characterized by particularly high levels of mitochondria . increased oxidative stress along with poor mitochondrial function in the placenta has been linked to growth restriction and premature fetal demise .",
            "mechanistically , oxidative stress may impact the ability of trophoblasts to transport nutrients between maternal and fetal circulation or carry out their endocrine functions .",
            "however , the exact linkage between placental oxidative stress and altered fetal growth and development remains undiscovered ( figure 2 ) .  ",
            "oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress have been linked and may jointly influence a number of cellular processes   .",
            "however , there has been very little work done to determine whether antipsychotics impact cellular er stress .",
            "research by kurosawa et al . suggests that the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine alleviates chemically induced er stress in cultured neurons .",
            "in addition to their effects on neuronal function , these drugs also impact reproductive functions such as fertility   and may also effect placental function . the mechanisms by which these drugs directly , as well as indirectly ( via modulation of metabolic homeostasis ) , influence fetal programming need to be more thoroughly investigated .",
            "there is currently considerable uncertainty regarding prescribing practices for pregnant women with severe and persistent psychiatric disorders .",
            "the physician and the mother have to balance the risks of untreated psychiatric illness , during pregnancy , against the potential fetal toxicity of atypical antipsychotic medications .",
            "atypical antipsychotics are suspected to be teratogenic , although there are no randomized controlled studies for obvious ethical reasons .",
            "the adverse metabolic side - effects of these medications compound the risks associated with teratogenicity . given that the number of women exposed to atypical antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy is increasing ,",

            "there is limited information regarding their impact of these compounds on placental development and/or function .",

        "golden_summary": "there is currently considerable uncertainty regarding prescribing practices for pregnant women with severe and persistent psychiatric disorders . the physician and the mother have to balance the risks of untreated psychiatric illness against the potential fetal toxicity associated with pharmacological exposure . this is especially true for women taking atypical antipsychotics . although these drugs have limited evidence for teratological risk , there are reports of altered fetal growth , both increased and decreased , with maternal atypical antipsychotic use . these effects may be mediated through changes in the maternal metabolism which in turn impacts placental function . however , the presence of receptors targeted by atypical antipsychotics in cell lineages present in the placenta suggests that these drugs can also have direct effects on placental function and development . the signaling pathways involved in linking the effects of atypical antipsychotics to placental dysfunction , ultimately resulting in altered fetal growth , remain elusive . this paper focuses on some possible pathways which may link atypical antipsychotics to placental dysfunction ."

            "this article will review the current status of  all - arterial  coronary bypass in current clinical practice .",
            "while a right i m a to left anterior descending ( lad ) coronary bypass was among the first coronary revascularizations performed and reported in 1967 , the subject was controversial until loop and associates demonstrated clear clinical benefits in the early 1980 s .",

            "while all - arterial bypass has become the most common coronary artery bypass graft ( cabg ) procedure in much of the world , recent assessment of us practice showed only about 4% of cabg cases involved",

            "certain principles have been useful in the transition to all - arterial coronary grafting , and subsequent sections document concepts involved with the evolution of this approach .",
            "all - arterial coronary bypass should start with multiple i m a grafts , which are the well - validated long - term conduits for coronary revascularization .  ",
            "single lima bypass with ra s constructed as t - grafts probably do not substitute prognostically for multiple i m a s . for some time",
            ", the authors have been performing multiple i m a bypasses in 75 - 80% of multivessel patients , including valve / cabg cases .",
            "performing bilateral i m a grafts is more time - consuming and technically demanding than saphenous vein procedures .",
            "one optimization factor for bilateral i m a s has been liberal use of right i m a ( rima ) to lad grafts ( figure 1a ) .",
            "see text for details . in the authors series , rima to lad procedures ( figure 1a )",
            "historic concerns regarding sternal re - entry with intact rima s traversing the midline have been dispelled by covering the graft with the thymic fat pad at the conclusion of the procedure , along with knowledge that only 4 - 5% of these patients required re - operation after 20-years .",
            "after placing the rima to the lad , the left i m a ( lima ) usually was used for single or sequential grafting of the circumflex coronary artery ( ccx ) system .",
            "the 1a approach optimized patency advantages of multiple i m a grafting , since both grafts have early patency rates of close to 100% in this configuration   .  ",
            "alternative configuration b , used in 1/3rd of the multivessel disease patients , involved placing the lima as a simple or sequential graft to the lad system , and anastomosing the rima to the right coronary artery ( rca ) ( figure 1b ) .   ",
            "this technique was applied more commonly in patients with proximal rca stenoses , in which the rima could reach the mid - rca easily . patencies and outcomes with this configuration have demonstrated equivalency to alternative a , understanding that in both approaches , i m a grafts should be placed to the largest , most important coronary vessels .  ",
            "although free i m a patencies have been good , free i m a grafts have been used infrequently in the authors practice , in order to simplify the procedure and to mitigate the necessity for extra anastomoses .",

            "proper preparation of the ra was important in the brompton trial in order to optimize graft patency , which exceeded 95% at 5-years in randomly selected patients .  ",

            "finally , in special cases , free i m a grafts are performed ( configuration c ) .",
            "figure 4 depicts coronary anatomy that mandated revascularization of 3 anterior wall vessels with a triple sequential lima graft , in the setting of a compromised important ccx system . in special cases ,",
            "this patient needed a triple sequential left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending system , so a free right internal mammary artery graft was placed to an important circumflex coronary artery marginal artery .",
            "the radial artery was placed to the distal right coronary artery , which was a previously stented infarct vessel and of tertiary importance .",
            "thus , the internal mammary artery grafts are usually reserved for the 2 most important coronary systems .",
            "therefore , the rima was constructed as a free graft to the large ccx vessel .",
            "thus , the relative size and importance of the coronary vessels and size of the viable myocardial regions are considered in configuration decisions , as well as the capabilities of individual arterial grafts in terms of length , coronary size - match , etc .",
            "however in over 75% of multivessel patients , at least 2 i m a s are used , and the lad is almost always revascularized with an i m a graft .",
            "many studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with multiple arterial grafts .   in our series , a multiple i m a approach to a mean follow up of 20-years   was associated with significant long - term reductions in death rates , non - fatal myocardial infarction , percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) , and redo coronary bypass ( figure 5 ) .",

",
            "more recent studies in the duke databank involving larger sample sizes and longer follow up are on - going and are confirming these findings .   ",
            "out to over 25 years of follow up , composite outcomes seem to improve as arterial grafts increase ( figure 6 ) , although this analysis is in preliminary stages and needs more scrutiny . in the larger duke university series ( n=19,483 )",
            "followed over 25 years , single internal mammary artery and adjunctive saphenous vein grafts were performed in 87% of coronary artery bypass surgery patients , multiple internal mammary artery grafts in 4% , and no internal mammary artery in 9% .",
            "the composite of all - cause death , non - fatal myocardial infarction , subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention , and redo coronary artery bypass surgery was the outcome variable .",
            "a small gradient in patient age existed between groups , with age in no internal mammary artery > single internal mammary artery > multiple internal mammary artery , so that further analysis , including multivariable risk adjustment , will be required .",
            "however , initial assessment reveals continually improving outcomes as arterial grafts are increased ( modified from ref .",
            "mima : multiple internal mammary artery , sima : single internal mammary artery , nima : no internal mammary artery .",
            "multiple i m a grafts seem to achieve the best results , although the magnitude of difference suggested in figure 6 may diminish after multivariable analysis is applied .",
            "lastly , ample data exist to confirm improved outcomes with ra conduits as adjunctive grafts to i m a s ( as compared to saphenous veins ) .  ",
            "so in summary , most studies confirm the benefits of performing more arterial grafts , and support the current trend toward all - arterial coronary bypass .",
            "meticulous surgical technique should be applied in harvesting fragile i m a and ra vessels to prevent spasm or intimal tears causing dissection .",
            "adequate flow should be confirmed before graft deployment to prevent the disastrous consequences of inserting a  bad  i m a or ra .   with experience and gentle technique ,",
            "sometimes , an i m a graft can be small , and it is often helpful to cut the vessel back to an adequate diameter for better flow .   occasionally , this requires shortening the i m a considerably and then converting it to a free graft .  ",
            "finally , ra grafts require very precise harvesting and proper preparation ( as described above ) to prevent local dissection or graft spasm , also termed a  string sign  .",
            "first , many studies have shown higher rates of sternal infection with mima grafting in diabetics .  ",
            "the subject of sternal infection involves a number of complex multivariable issues , including operating room technique and others .",
            "graft skeletonization can be helpful , but another important factor is effective topical antibiotic irrigation at the end of the procedure which , in several randomized trials , reduced sternal infection rates from 2 - 3% in control groups to around 0.5% .    with such methods ( vancomycin - 1 gm and gentamicin - 80 mg in one liter of warm saline for irrigation at the conclusion of the procedure ) , it has been possible to liberally apply bilateral i m a procedures , so that diabetics can undergo routine all - arterial grafting with negligible sternal complications .",
            "bilateral i m a harvesting does increase early postoperative discomfort , and with longer cardiopulmonary bypass times , minor morbidities ( such as postoperative bleeding ) are slightly increased .    in the opinion of the authors , the trade - off of improved long - term results warrants this early morbidity , and most analyses",

            ", surgery and pci are becoming complementary rather than competitive , and in coming years , all - arterial coronary bypass should play an increasingly important role in the treatment of coronary artery disease ."

            "based on its ease of use and the ability to precisely position the probe within the distal duct , radiofrequency ablation may represent the first viable treatment adjunct for this challenging scenario .",
            "to date , only single case reports of rfa for benign ampullary lesions have been described ; we aimed to expand our understanding of this technology by presenting our experience in 5 patients .  ",
            "catheter - based rfa was technically successful in all cases , and based on short - term follow up in a small sample , may be safe and clinically effective .",
            "however , because rfa induces thermal injury and subsequent necrosis of the bile duct wall and beyond , several safety concerns exist .",
            "first , while rfa has been associated with a favorable safety profile when applied to malignant biliary strictures 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 , it remains unclear whether rfa in the intra - pancreatic portion of the bile duct without the protective buffer of a surrounding tumor  especially in the vicinity of the pancreatic orifice  will be associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis . until additional data on the risk of post - ercp pancreatitis in this context",
            "if the pancreatic and biliary orifices are in close proximity , especially if adenoma appears to involve the pancreaticobiliary septum , it may be best to perform the rfa adjacent to a guidewire which has already been placed in the pancreatic duct ( subsequently guaranteeing pancreatic access for stent placement ) rather than adjacent to a plastic pancreatic stent which may be damaged or even fractured during rfa .  ",
            "another safety concern is the development of clinically important post - rfa biliary strictures that occurred in 1 of our patients , akin to what has been observed in the esophagus after rfa of barrett s epithelium 13 .",
            "this concern is particularly relevant in the context of benign ampullary disease in which patients do not typically undergo long - term stent placement , as is the case when rfa is performed for palliation of malignant strictures . along these lines , until additional data are available , we have attempted to minimize rfa across the cystic duct takeoff to avoid thermal injury - related obstruction of the cystic duct , which has intentionally been induced by electrohydraulic lithotripsy to treat refractory bile leak 14 .   in our series",
            ", rfa appears to have provided effective adjunctive therapy in all 4 cases of benign pathology but was ineffective in the setting of early adenocarcinoma , underscoring the concept that surgical resection remains first - line therapy for ampullary cancer ( our patient declined surgery and chemoradiation ) . despite the apparent effectiveness for benign lesions , it is important to consider that intrabiliary extension is often nodular in nature , leading to heterogeneous contact between the rfa probe and the target tissue ; this may lead to incomplete therapy and/or an increased risk of buried neoplasm as is the concern when rfa is used to treat nodular barrett s esophagus .",
            "moreover , it can be technically challenging to ensure circumferential contact of the probe and the target tissue within a dilated bile duct , even when luminal air is suctioned to induce collapse of the duct around the probe . in these cases , a balloon - based rfa device that flattens nodular tissue and maximizes treatment contact may be of value .",
            "an additional consideration is that the proximal extent of neoplasm is often difficult to assess cholangiographically and the role of cholangioscopy to guide probe placement should be further explored .",
            "prospective studies are necessary to evaluate these issues and determine the long - term effectiveness of this modality .   in summary , catheter - based rfa after endoscopic resection of ampullary lesions that extend up the bile duct is technically feasible .",
            "concerns regarding injury to the pancreas and bile duct as well as incomplete treatment of nodular target tissue exist and will be addressed by additional clinical experience and research ."

            "in 1982 chang and der , two postdoctoral fellows working in geoffrey cooper 's laboratory , discovered kristen rat sarcoma virus and murine sarcoma virus ; retroviral oncogenes related to rodent sarcoma virus genes . the human kras gene is a homolog of these two oncogenes",
            ". a normal form of human c - ras has been called kras or kras2 ( kristen rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog or alternatively kristen murine sarcoma virus2 homolog ) . in 1983",
            ", der described an abnormal form of the p21 protein expressed by colon and lung carcinoma cell lines and showed that the gene encoding this protein is able to transform nih3t3 cells .",
            "this finding was later confirmed by parada and weinberg , who described the transformation of nih3t3 cells by an activated kras oncogene .",
            "aberrant p21 proteins were encoded by the altered kras gene and their expression in carcinoma tissue was causally linked to an abnormal state of activation . since then , it has been accepted that kras is one of front - line sensors that initiate the activation of an array of signalling molecules allowing the transmission of transducting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus , thus affecting cell differentiation , growth , chemotaxis , and apoptosis . a signal transduction cascade initiated by the activated form of kras",
            "kras elicits changes in the cytoskeleton and consequently affects cell shape , adhesion and migration   . in the following paragraphs , kras protein , gene , oncogenesis , and cancer therapy is reviewed",
            "kras belongs to a group of small gtp - binding proteins , known as the ras superfamily or ras - like gtpases .",
            "the entire ras superfamily is characterised by the presence of a catalytic g domain , but includes members with distinct evolutionary specializations with respect to different cellular process .",
            "the ras subfamily ( ras , rho , rab , arf , rac , and ran ) includes the most frequently studied proteins , such as harvey - ras ( h - ras ) , neuroblastoma - ras ( n - ras ) , and two variants of kristen - ras ( k - ras)one , known as kras4a , which is weakly expressed in human cells and the dominant form , known as kras4b , which is much more highly expressed .",
            "the kras gene product , kras protein , contains 188 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 21.6  kd and participates in intracellular signal transduction .",
            "as mentioned above , the kras protein remains inactive until it binds to gtp , as depicted in figure 2 .",
            "once the gtp is bound to the kras protein , kras undergoes conformational changes that involve two regions of the protein , thus activating it .",
            "these two important regions are known as switch 1 ( aminoacids 3038 ) and switch 2 ( aminoacids 5967 ) , which form an effector loop , controlling the specificity of the binding of this gtpase to its effector molecules .",
            "this conformational change in the kras protein affects its interactions with multiple downstream transducers  gtpase - activating proteins ( gaps)which amplify the gtpase activity of the ras protein 100,000-fold .",
            "the change also affects interactions with guanine - exchanging / releasing factors ( gefs / grfs ) promoting the release of gtp .",
            "the kras protein also has intrinsic gtpase activity , stimulated by gaps , which acts as a timer associated with direct interactions with the effectors .",
            "mutations found in an oncogenic form of the ras p21 protein impair gtpase activity and make the kras protein unresponsive to gap proteins . mutated forms of p21 rapidly exchange gdp for gtp , which it prefers as a substrate , thus inducing the active state .",
            "such aberrant forms of kras protein deregulate many effectors , thus affecting several important cellular pathways .",
            "many gtp derivatives targeting ras or raf effectors have been developed to repair the defective gtpase activity that influences the aberrant ras signalling .",
            "however , little is known about the specificity and transport of compounds modified by gtps through the plasma membrane .",
            "the first domain includes 85 amino acids at the n - terminus and is identical in the three forms of ras ( kras , nras , and hras ) .",
            "the second domain contains 80 amino acids , with lower sequence identity ( 7080% ) among the three forms of ras protein .",
            "these regions are important for the signalling function of the kras protein and jointly form the g - domain ( amino acids 1165 , figure 3 ) .",
            "the g - domain of the kras protein includes the gtp - binding pocket , where p - loop - phosphate binding loops ( aminoacids 1016 and 5659 ) interact with the b - phosphate and c - phosphate of gtp .",
            "the region between amino acids 32 and 40 ( the core effector region ) is essential for the interactions between the putative downstream effectors and gaps .",
            "ras protein also contains a hypervariable region ( hvr ) at the c - terminus ( amino acids 165188/189 ; the third domain ) , which guides posttranslational modification and determines plasma membrane anchoring .",
            "this region plays an important role in the regulation of the biological activity of ras protein .",
            "switch regions i and ii play important roles in the binding of regulators and effectors .",
            "the phosphate binding pocket - p loop permits temporary binding of gtp to the ras protein .",
            "this is also the region of gtpase activity , which negatively regulates the ras protein via a ras - gtp hydrolysis reaction and binding of guanosine diphosphate .  ",
            "the kras protein acts like a plasma membrane - localized molecular switch , regulating multiple signal transduction pathways .",
            "it is synthesized in the cytosol , where it is farnesylated by farnesyl transferase at the cysteine residue of the carboxy - terminal motif caax ( where c represents cysteine , a is an aliphatic amino acid , and x is any amino acid ) .",
            "the aax amino acid motif is cleaved by proteases , whereas the c - terminal carboxyl residue of the kras protein is methylated .",
            "cleavage of the axx peptide motif and methylation occur at the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmatic reticulum and are mediated by the ras - converting enzyme rce1 .",
            "c - terminal farnesylation plays an important role in membrane localization . in the splice variant kras4a , the axx motif undergoes additional palmitoylation by palmitoyl transferase , resulting in proper targeting of kras4a to the membrane . however , there is no detectable palmitoylation of the predominant splice variant kras4b , which probably reaches the plasma membrane via a microtubule - dependent mechanism , thus avoiding the golgi apparatus   .",
            "posttranslational farnesylation and carboxymethylation are believed to be important for the oncogenicity of the ras protein .",
            "treatment with farnesyl transferase inhibitors has been shown to inhibit anchorage - independent growth of both kras - transformed mouse fibroblasts and human tumour cells containing kras and nras mutations .",
            "activation of downstream signalling pathways by kras can also be triggered by signals from subcellular compartments , such as the endoplasmatic reticulum and the golgi apparatus   .",
            "while wild - type kras usually promotes cell cycle progression , it can also induce growth arrest , apoptosis , and replicative senescence when increased to abnormal levels .",
            "this can be triggered by cellular stress , ultraviolet or ionizing irradiation , heat shock , and some cytokines .",
            "in these circumstances , triggering of growth arrest can represent a defence mechanism against inappropriate activation of ras .",
            "it has been demonstrated that the wild - type kras gene is a tumour suppressor that is frequently lost during tumour progression in many types of cancer .",
            "once the kras gene mutates , it acquires oncogenic properties ( table 1 ) and seems to be causally involved in the development of various human cancers   .",
            "loss of the wild - type kras allele has been observed in both human and mouse tumours , indicating that absence of the normal allele may facilitate transformation by one copy of the oncogenic kras allele .",
            "oncogenic mutations in the kras gene prevent the hydrolysis of gtp , thus permanently activating the ras molecules .",
            "expression of a mutated kras gene in fibroblasts has been shown to augment metalloproteinase 2 ( mmp2 ) expression in the matrix and enhance the invasion of cancer cells .",
            "overexpression of this mutated form of kras also inhibits glycosylation of the integrin 1-chain , resulting in altered polarisation and increased adhesiveness of colon cancer cells .",
            "in addition , expression of this oncogenic form of kras protein has been shown to be associated with upregulated carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) expression and disturbance of epithelial cell polarization .",
            "there are two copies of the kras gene in the human genome , designated kras1 and kras2 .",
            "the mrna encoded by the main kras2 is 5.5  kb long , and differs from transcripts of the transforming kristen murine viral gene by only six codons .",
            "analysis of human placental and embryonic cdna libraries has revealed that 900  bp of the kras1 gene is homologous to the corresponding sequence of the kristen murine sarcoma virus2 homolog , with one intervening sequence , and 300  bp of the kras2 is fully homologous to the viral counterpart . the kras1 gene is a pseudogene derived from kras2 by alternative mrna splicing .",
            "mcbride and colleagues found that the protooncogenes kras1 and kras2 are localized at human chromosomes 6 and 12 , respectively .",
            "later , kras1 and kras2 were mapped by in situ hybridization to chromosome positions 6p11 - 12 and 12p11.1 - 12.1 , respectively .",
            "alternative splicing of exon 4 produces two mrna forms , known as 4a and 4b .",
            "exon 5 can be skipped during alternative splicing , giving rise to isoforms krasa and krasb .",
            "the 6th exon encodes the c - terminal region in krasb and is not translated ( the 3untranslated region , 3utr ) in krasa .",
            "krasb is the predominant splice variant of kras2 , and is referred to , briefly , as kras .",
            "there are indications that allelic losses of chromosome region 12p commonly occur in human cancers , and a frequently deleted region is near the kras gene at position 12p12 - 13 .",
            "further , recent studies on lung adenocarcinoma suggest there is an association between the incidence of allelic losses in the 12p12 - 13 region and kras gene mutation",
            ". diagnostics of kras gene mutations in clinical setting is limited by two factors : first , in the time of testing , kras mutated tumour cells may be in minority , outbalanced by wild type tumour cells and wild type non - tumour cells present in the sample .",
            "second , analytically preferable snap - frozen tumour samples are rarely available for kras mutation testing . instead , formalin fixed paraffin - embedded ( ffpe ) tissue is used . there , integrity of dna may be severely compromised by procedure of formalin fixation ( especially by its long duration and low ph ) .",
            "all the known principles of dna polymorphism detection are applicable to kras mutation detection and demand a dedicated review outside of the scope of this paper .",
            "more than 60 methods described can be divided into sequencing methods   , methods based on specific interaction with oligonucleotide , methods based on specific interaction with enzyme   , and conformational methods   . while many specificity and/or sensitivity enhancement of methods were described as well   , analytical validation , systematic comparison , and assessment of methods side by side is lacking . to authors",
            "best knowledge , only communaut europene ( ce ) marked kras mutation detection kits are supplied by dxs ( mutations in codons 12 a 13 are tested using principle of arms - pcr   and scorpion primers , vienna - lab ( reverse dot blot assay format ) , tib molbiol ( kras lightmix clamped hybridization probes for codon 12 ) , and invigene ( qpcr with sequence suppressor agent stopprimer for the unwanted excess component , applicable for first two nucleotide positions in codons 12 and 13 ) . \n",
            "kras expression is regulated both during the initiation of transcription by the binding of proteins to its promoter and during transcriptional elongation by micrornas affecting kras mrna stability .",
            "both human and murine kras gene promoters contain a nuclease hypersensitive polypurine - polypyrimidine element ( nhppe ) .",
            "the g - rich strand of nhppe located in the proximal promoter sequence is able to form an intramolecular parallel g - quadruplex , consisting of three g - tetrads and three loops , which recognizes and binds nuclear proteins that are involved in transcriptional repression of kras expression .",
            "accordingly , it has been reported that sequestration of nuclear proteins that bind to nhpp by an oligonucleotide mimicking the kras g - quadruplex resulted in 40% inhibition of kras transcription , compared to controls .",
            "the transcription of kras is regulated , in part , by an interaction between the promoter region and the 65  kda esxr1 protein and , in part , by micrornas ( mirnas ) .",
            "esxr1 is a human protein with an n - terminal homeodomain in the nucleus and a c - terminal proline - rich repeat region i in the cytoplasm .",
            "the n - terminal fragment of esxr1 binds to the taatgttatta consensus sequence in exon-1 of the kras gene , thus inhibiting its mrna expression .",
            "mirnas contain a 21 - 22 nucleotide long noncoding sequence that is able to regulate gene expression . in 2005",
            "it was estimated that there are more than 500 mirnas , which collectively regulate approximately 30% of all human genes , including the ras gene family .",
            "regulation of gene expression by mirnas probably occurs as a result of imperfect hybridization of the mirna to the complementary sequences located in the 3untranslated region ( 3utr ) of target messenger rna ( mrna ) species .",
            "this interaction between mirna and mrna both decreases mrna stability and represses protein synthesis by preventing access to ribosomes .",
            "interestingly , many altered mirnas have been identified in human cancers   , including some of the most thoroughly analyzed mirnas ",
            "members of one group , the oncomirs , are upregulated in cancer and can act like oncogenes .",
            "the second group , the anti - oncomirs , probably act as tumour suppressors by targeting oncogenes , repressing the cell cycle and division of cancer cells .",
            "for example , mirna - let7 is an oncogene - antioncomir pair that negatively regulates ras protein levels and decreases cell proliferation rates   .",
            "kras , nras , and hras harbour multiple let-7 mirna complementary sites ( lcss ) in their 3utrs .",
            "zhang et al .   found that reducing the activity of let-7 in hela cells resulted in a 70% increase in ras protein levels , while takamizawa et al .  ",
            "found that let-7 expression was 80% lower in 60% of lung cancer adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma lines than in normal lung tissue .",
            "moreover , a correlation between low levels of let-7 mirna and significantly higher ras protein expression has been found in lung squamous cell carcinomas .",
            "these results suggest that let-7 is able to downregulate the expression of ras in human carcinomas .",
            "these molecular findings provide a strong rationale for developing novel therapeutic treatments aimed at decreasing kras protein expression in cancer cells . in many cases kras protein expression",
            "is dramatically increased due to mutations in the kras gene sequence , thus making cells refractory to current therapies , such as those involving use of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors .",
            "such oncogenic forms of the kras gene are prevalent in pancreatic carcinomas ( > 80% ) , colon carcinomas ( 4050% ) , and lung carcinomas ( 3050% ) , but are also present in biliary tract malignancies , endometrial cancer , cervical cancer , bladder cancer , liver cancer , myeloid leukemia   and breast cancer .",
            "mutations in the kras gene have important effects on the process of carcinogenesis , which depend on the cells and tissues involved .",
            "the mutations found most frequently in the kras gene of cancer cells are located at positions 12 and 13 in exon 1 , and less frequently in codons 61 , 63 , 117 , 119 , and 146   .",
            "allelic mutations result in amino acid changes , namely gly to asp , ala , arg , ser , val , or cys in codon 12 and gly to asp in codon 13 .",
            "somatic missense mutations at positions 12 , 13 , 61 , and 63 enable perturbation of the intrinsic gtpase activity of the kras protein , resulting in reductions in gtp hydrolysis capacity .",
            "mutations in codons 12 ( figure 4 ) or 13 are known to lead to conformational changes in the kras protein .",
            "mutation in codon 12 of the kras gene causes the encoded kras protein to  freeze  in its active state for a much longer duration than its nonmutated counterpart .",
            "mutations resulting in the substitution of amino acids 116 , 117 , 119 , and 146 reduce the nucleotide affinity of the kras protein , thereby affecting the rate of gdp / gtp exchange .",
            "the oncogenic forms of the ras protein have a profound effect on the downstream effector pathways , resulting in much higher proliferation rates of cancer cells expressing such forms .",
            "the transforming ability of the kras oncogene may result from overexpression of the mutant kras allele or from deletion of the wild - type allele .",
            "overexpression of kras can also be induced by the loss of p16ink4 ( cdkn2a ) , p19ink4 ( cdkn2d ) , or p53 .",
            "( 2001 ) have shown that the wild - type kras allele can suppress the oncogenic function of the mutated allele .  ",
            "in addition , the radiosensitivity of tumour cells is altered by oncogenic ras expression , probably as a result of the effect of the kras mutation on several intercommunicating pathways .",
            "the prevalence of mutations in the kras gene at the time of diagnosis is highest in pancreatic cancers ( > 80% of cases ) , notably pancreatic adenocarcinomas predominantly harbour kras forms with a guanine to thymine transversion in codon 12 .",
            "wei and colleagues examined samples collected from 30 patients with pancreatic cancer and found that 24 of them showed mutations at codon 12 and only one at codon 13 . however , concurrent kras mutations frequently occur in patients with pancreatic cancer . a positive association has been found in patients with pancreatic cancer between tobacco exposure and mutations in the kras gene .",
            "similar associations have also been reported for coffee drinking , and milk , butter , and alcohol consumption   .",
            "however , no direct evidence of a causal relationship between these dietary components and mutations in the kras gene has been presented .",
            "the second highest incidence ( about 50% of cases ) of mutations in the kras gene is found in colon cancers   .",
            "the first stage is characterized by the development of a small , benign tubular type of adenoma or polyp with sporadically detectable kras mutation(s ) .",
            "the second stage is more aggressive and is usually associated with patches of definitive carcinoma cells , which may grow into invasive cancers characterising the third stage .",
            "mutations of the kras gene have been identified in tissues from both adenoma and carcinoma cases , but at much lower frequencies in colon adenoma tissues than in carcinoma tissues   .",
            "the incidence of mutation in the kras gene has been found to be low and to occur mainly in the small adenomas of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis , who have a predisposition to colon cancer   in the kras gene associated with colon cancer appear most often in codons 12 ( 28% ) and 13 ( 8% ) of exon 1 and less frequently in codon 61 . in colorectal cancer ,",

            "mutation from ggt ( gly ) to gtt ( val ) in codon 12 has been observed more frequently in primary metastatic carcinoma , suggesting that this mutation may confer a more aggressive phenotype in colorectal carcinoma .",
            "a mutation in codon 13 , resulting in the substitution of gly with asp , observed in colon cancer has been shown to be associated with reduced survival rates .",
            "this kind of kras gene mutation has also been shown to occur more frequently in unstable , than in stable , colon tumours   .",
            "losses of kras wild type alleles in both mouse and human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous carcinomas have been found in many studies , notably in 67% to 100% of chemically induced murine lung adenocarcinoma cases harbouring a mutant kras . in humans ,",

            "however , gefitinib did not pass the registration procedure in the european union because insufficient clinical benefit was demonstrated , probably because european clinical trials did not include sufficient  good responders ",
            "clinical data also suggest that the drug represents a new therapeutic option for nsclc patients with brain metastases .",
            "after the successful tribute and talent clinical trials , erlotinib ( tarceva ) was also approved by the us fda in 2002 as a second or third line treatment for nsclc after failure of standard chemotherapy . however , molecular analysis revealed that patients who have activating mutations in the kras gene ( exon 1 : codons 12 , 13 , or 61 ) with or without increases in egfr copy numbers did not derive benefit from this therapy and had about a 96% chance of disease progression .",
            "similarly , eberhard et al . first observed the relationship between kras mutations and the outcome of erlotinib therapy in a randomized phase iii clinical trial in which the drug was used , in combination with first line  gold standard  chemotherapy ( carboplatin and paclitaxel ) , to treat advanced nsclc patients .",
            "patients with the kras mutation exhibited a shorter time to progression ( three months ) and a shorter overall survival ( four months ) when treated with a combination of erlotinib and first line chemotherapy , such as treatment with cisplatin , compared to the group with wild - type kras , for whom the time - to - progression was 12 months .",
            "most nsclc patients in the erlotinib treatment study had expressed wild - type kras , and their kras status had greater prognostic than predictive value as a biomarker .",
            "however , in colorectal cancer , mutations in the kras gene are important predictive ( as well as prognostic ) biomarkers , since the effectiveness of treatment with cetuximab and panitumumab is impaired in tumours with the activating mutation .",
            "information regarding the status of the kras gene allows the selection of appropriate therapies for patients who do not display activating mutations and the selection of alternative therapies for patients with mutations . although results pertaining to the role of kras in the prognosis of clinical outcome or prediction of therapeutic responses to egfr1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are interesting , they need to be validated in larger and prospective trials , using standardized and sensitive mutation detection techniques .",
            "if the associations are confirmed , knowledge of the mutation status of kras in nsclc tumours could help physicians decide which patients should receive gefitinib and/or erlotinib .",
            "interestingly , kras gene mutations also seem to provide strong predictive indication of therapeutic responses to other classes of tyrosine kinase inhibitors , as recently demonstrated for the imatinib mesylate ( glivec ) .",
            "imatinib is the standard drug for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia ( cml ) and patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours ( gists ) , expressing the bcr - abl fusion protein and tyrosine kinase receptor c - kit , respectively .",
            "further , drug resistance to imatinib is usually attributed to mutation of the imatinib - binding sites of these proteins , although amplification of the bcr - abl fusion gene or overexpression of multidrug resistance proteins may be involved in some cases . however , a recent study by agarwal et al .",
            "colorectal cancer is another frequent neoplasia that is associated with activation of the egfr1 pathway , so it is not surprising that novel and successful therapeutic strategies for this condition involve egfr1 protein kinase inhibition .",
            "in contrast to nsclc , two monoclonal antibodies against egfr1 , rather than small molecular inhibitors of egfr1 , are generally used for treating colorectal cancer : cetuximab ( erbitux ) and panitumumab ( vectibix ) . in accordance with the effect of small molecular egfr1 inhibitors in nsclc , kras alterations play a critical role in the response of colorectal cancer patients to such therapeutic monoclonal antibodies .",
            "indeed , kras mutation status is the most important predictor of resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab ; both the median progression - free survival of cetuximab - treated patients and overall survival was recently found to be superior in a kras wild - type group than in a kras mutant group ( 31 versus 10 weeks , and 16 versus 7 months , respectively ) . on september 27 , 2006 , the us fda approved the completely humanized monoclonal anti - egfr1 igg2 antibody  panitumumab ( vectibix ) for clinical use in the third line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who had progressed after standard chemotherapy .  ",
            "kras panitumumab therapy was tested in a randomized study involving 463 patients , and the results showed that the wild - type kras gene is essential for its therapeutic activity .",
            "progression - free survival of patients with wild - type versus mutant kras gene tumours was 12 versus seven weeks , while response rates obtained in another study were 17% versus 0% .",
            "these findings strongly indicate that kras gene status should be routinely tested as a critically important diagnostic biomarker to determine which patients will derive therapeutic benefit from egfr1 inhibition .",
            "indeed , analysis of the kras gene status in colorectal cancer cases has become conditio sinequa non for deciding whether or not to apply cetuximab or panitumumab therapy in routine clinical practice and fda has updated vectibix and erbitux labels in 2009 to include this information .",
            "surprisingly , the effects of kras gene mutations on tumour sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapies and radiation have only been explored in a few studies . however , expression of a 12 val mutated form of kras has been shown to increase the resistance of cancer cells to radiation therapy .",
            "similarly , the presence of oncogenic kras has been found to significantly increase the sensitivity of cells to a novel class of anticancer agents , cucurbitacins , in a p53- or p21-dependent manner .",
            "in contrast , an ovarian cancer cell line tov-21 g bearing a mutant allele of kras is reportedly significantly more sensitive to cisplatin and radiation , but not to paclitaxel or campthotecin , than the corresponding kras wild type line .",
            "however , results of clinical studies by rosell and colleagues ( 1995 ) showed that patients with a mutation in the kras gene had poorer clinical responses to paclitaxel monotherapy than wild type controls , suggesting that kras gene status is a predictive marker of paclitaxel resistance . in a phase iii retrospective study on nsclc patients ( tribute ) ,",
            "randomly treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel with erlotinib or placebo , patients with kras mutant tumours showed poorer clinical outcomes when treated with erlotinib plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone . an updated clinical trial ( crystal ) involving 540 metastatic colorectal cancer patients demonstrated that cetuximab in combination with folfiri ( folic acid , fluorouracil , and irinotecan ) in first line therapy is highly effective against kras wild type , but not mutant , tumours .",
            "however , further analysis of the data showed that neither the response nor the progression - free survival of patients treated with chemotherapy alone were significantly affected by kras gene status , although the overall survival of patients with kras mutant tumours was significantly shorter than that of patients with kras wild type tumours .",
            "recently we have also shown that egfr may represent a predictive molecular marker for poor response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced gastric carcinoma .",
            "responses to chemoradiotherapy were found in 60% of egfr - negative patients , but only 13% of egfr - positive patients ( p =  .044 ) , and pathologic complete responses were observed in 29% of patients with egfr - negative staining , but none ( of eight ) egfr - positive patients ( p =  .16 ) .",
            "the above findings regarding the role of the kras gene in tumour responses to cytotoxic therapies appear to conflict somewhat .",
            "the predictive and prognostic significance of oncogenic kras seems to have been mixed in many studies , and the contributions of variations in the gene to clinical outcome appear to differ according to tumour types and therapeutic interventions . clearly , further studies are urgently needed to confirm and clarify the findings in large prospective biomarker - oriented clinical trials .",
            "other clinical trials have also demonstrated that activating mutations in the kras gene can contribute to tumour progression by affecting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , which plays a critical role in tumour angiogenesis .",
            "inhibition of kras expression by selected kras antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to be associated with significantly reduced secretion of vegf - a165 into the medium of colorectal cancer cell cultures .",
            "in addition , in a cohort of patients with pancreatic tumours , 25/33 ( 76% ) with kras mutations showed higher vegf expression , and their median survival was shorter , than those with tumours expressing the wild - type allele .",
            "similar findings have also been reported from a study of nsclcs , in which higher vegf expression was observed in 50% of tumours bearing a kras gene mutation .",
            "although these studies suggest that kras gene status could play an important role in responses to anti - vegf targeted antiangiogenic therapy , a recent study by hurwitz and saini   showed that groups of patients bearing either kras mutant or wild - type tumours derive therapeutic benefit from first line application of the anti - vegf monoclonal antibody bevacizumab ( avastin ) .",
            "furthermore , although both groups of patients ( i.e. , those with wild - type kras and mutated kras genes ) benefited from adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy , both progression - free survival and survival was better for wild - type kras patients , both with chemotherapy alone and with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab .",
            "bevacizumab did not increase the percentage of patients with mutated kras who responded to treatment .",
            "an optimal therapeutic drug should be able to specifically target the mutated kras gene or its product , have minimal systemic toxicity and be orally active .",
            "unfortunately , drugs like this remain to be developed and less efficient strategies need to be used in clinical trials .",
            "however , in addition to the cancer therapies mentioned above , several therapeutic agents and strategies can directly suppress the activating mutant form of the kras gene , and thus improve the efficiency of chemotherapy and biological therapy .",
            "one possible approach for inhibiting kras expression is to use antisense oligonucleotides or viral constructs delivering antisense sequences in order to inactivate the mutant oncogene rna message .",
            "in addition , synthesis of mutated kras protein has been repressed by applying a small interfering adenovirus - mediated rna ( sirna ) , and the specifically designed sirna was shown to have prolonged anti - proliferative effects against various tumour cancer cell lines expressing mutated kras proteins .",
            "another , similar strategy to target mutant kras mrna is based on designing an mrna ribozyme that specifically interacts with a mutated form of the kras mrna and encodes catalytic rna molecules that bind to the mrna substrate by base - pair complementation , leading to translation arrest and/or degradation of the specific mrna .",
            "the kras - specific ribozyme strategy has also been shown to suppress successfully the proliferation of kras - mutated tumour cells .",
            "recently an interesting novel strategy employing farnesyltransferase inhibitors ( ftis ) was shown to inhibit the biochemical transactivation initiated by the mutated kras gene .",
            "farnesyl transferase is an enzyme that primarily regulates zinc metabolism by the addition of a farnesyl group to the cysteine residue of a protein .",
            "at least 30 proteins ( including kras ) require posttranslational farnesylation to reach their membrane positions and function properly in cell signalling .",
            "farnesyl inhibitors represent a novel class of biologically active anticancer drugs that inhibit cell growth .",
            "after the discovery that ras proteins have to be farnesylated to become functionally active , several farnesyl inhibitors were developed .",
            "however , phase ii and phase iii clinical trials conducted to date have found that kras ftis might not be sufficient to inhibit the mutated - overactive forms of kras protein .",
            "the reason for this is probably incomplete inhibition of farnesylation , because garnesylation of kras protein by geranyltransferase i leads to suppression of the effects of farnesyltransferase inhibitors   .",
            "it should be noted that although kras inhibitory strategies have shown promise in preclinical trials and have been partially successful in clinical trials , there are insufficient data on their efficacy in combination with anti - egfr1 strategies to recommend their routine use as yet .",
            "the evidence from various studies summarized in this review demonstrates that the kras protein is an important signal transducer involved in the regulation of various cellular responses during cell proliferation , differentiation , and survival .",
            "a pivotal function of kras protein in the regulation of the mapk and pi3k / akt pathways is its effect on the proliferation rate of both normal and cancer cells . activating mutations of the kras protein , which frequently occur in cancer cells ,",
            "overall , this review summarizes novel approaches allowing the management of cancers with or without kras mutations , and highlights the importance of early identification of somatic mutations in the kras gene in cancer biopsies ."

        "golden_summary": "the kras gene ( ki - ras2 kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ) is an oncogene that encodes a small gtpase transductor protein called kras . kras is involved in the regulation of cell division as a result of its ability to relay external signals to the cell nucleus . activating mutations in the kras gene impair the ability of the kras protein to switch between active and inactive states , leading to cell transformation and increased resistance to chemotherapy and biological therapies targeting epidermal growth factor receptors . this review highlights some of the features of the kras gene and the kras protein and summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism of kras gene regulation . it also underlines the importance of activating mutations in the kras gene in relation to carcinogenesis and their importance as diagnostic biomarkers , providing clues regarding human cancer patients ' prognosis and indicating potential therapeutic approaches ."

            "for this analysis we had a low power ; therefore , we can not exclude a relationship of the snp with this parameter .",
            "because there was a clear - cut higher liver fat content , but no increase in insulin resistance in carriers of the minor g allele compared to c allele homozygotes , we hypothesized that specifically pnpla3-mediated accumulation of liver fat appears to be metabolically benign .",
            "if this was the case , then for a similar amount of liver fat g allele carriers must be more insulin sensitive than c allele homozygotes .",

            "because these findings are derived from a more obese smaller subsample of the study population , the effects of pnpla3 may be important particularly in obesity .",

            "conversely , antisense oligonucleotide treatment targeting the dgat2 reduced liver triglycerides in mice fed a high - fat diet , without improving insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance ( 38 ) . in agreement with these data we found that a snp in dgat2 was associated with liver fat but not with insulin resistance in humans ( 39 ) .",
            "another candidate is the elongation of long - chain fatty acids ( elovl ) gene ( elovl6 ) .",
            "elovl catalyzes the conversion of palmitate to stearate as well as palmitoleate to vaccinate , thus regulating the hepatic fatty acid composition ( 40 ) .",
            "mice deficient for elovl6 developed obesity and hepatic steatosis , but not insulin resistance , hyperinsulinemia , or hyperglycemia under a high - fat diet ( 41 ) .",
            "the paradox of this finding may be because of lipotoxicity ( 42 ) . according to this concept , triglycerides are probably the least toxic form in which the lipid excess can be stored in ectopic tissues , at least in the short - term .",
            "the incorporation of fatty acids into triglycerides , as well as their oxidative degradation , thus represents protection from lipotoxicity .",
            "however , when these compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed , fatty acids induce damage to cells resulting in impaired metabolism ( 43,44 ) .",
            "several pathways are thought to be operative in this process . among them , activation of nuclear factor-b and c - jun nh2-terminal kinase , which are involved in insulin resistance ( 14,45,46 ) , are critical . besides these proinflammatory pathways fatty acid and diacylglycerol ( dag ) directly activate protein kinase c- , thus inhibiting hepatic insulin signaling ( 41,47,48 ) . what is the putative role of pnpla3/adiponutrin in these pathways ?",
            "data in the literature strongly support that it probably has no lipase activity ( 49,50 ) but rather lipogenic functions in adipose tissue under feeding conditions , particularly under carbohydrate intake ( 30,31 ) .",
            "it was further hypothesized that if this protein has similar functions in the liver , then increased hepatic expression or activity may result in increased triglyceride synthesis ( 31,49 ) .",
            "pnpla3/adiponutrin was found to have transacetylase functions and uses dag as an acyl acceptor ( 31,32,49 ) .",
            "therefore , increased activity of the protein may also result in depletion in the hepatic dag and fatty acid content , both of which are involved in lipotoxicity ( 47,48 ) .",
            "thus , this protective mechanism may result in a metabolically benign phenotype under increased lipid load by partitioning excess hepatic fatty acids to triglycerides that may protect against lipotoxicity . in support of this hypothesis",
            ", we found that in carriers of the minor rs738409 g allele , the mrna expression of the proinflammatory gene tnf- in the liver was less strongly associated with triglyceride content compared to c allele homozygotes .",
            "what may be the clinical implication of these findings ? because fatty liver is becoming a worldwide epidemic , it is necessary not only to screen for its presence but also for control subjects at the highest risk for fatty liver  induced complications .",
            "if further studies confirm the role of pnpla3/adiponutrin in the generation of steatosis without complications , then screening for genetic variation in pnpla3 may help to stratify this risk . in conclusion ,",
            "the snp rs738409 in pnpla3 is strongly , and independently of total and visceral adiposity , associated with fatty liver but not with insulin resistance or estimates of liver injury .",

            "the finding in this study is comparable with studies done in enugu in nigeria11 and addis ababa in ethiopia,21 which also showed lack of depth of knowledge .",
            "this finding shows that ocgs knowledge on the partograph is far below expectation , and therefore many of them will not be maximally utilized in public health hospitals and primary health care centers .",
            "this therefore informs the need for urgent steps to improve the partographic knowledge of ocgs through continuous training programs in order to increase its use .",
            "this study also revealed that knowledge of the partograph and its availability had a significant relationship with its utilization .",
            "this finding is similar to a study conducted in ogun state , southwestern nigeria , among ocgs in peripheral maternity centers , which showed low levels of utilization due to poor knowledge of the partograph.10 also , analysis drawn from recent studies within the maternity units of the two tertiary health care delivery centers in yenagoa , bayelsa state , nigeria , indicated a statistically significant relationship between the availability and use of this tool in labor.8 prolonged and obstructed labor contribute significantly to maternal morbidity and mortality in nigeria and many other resource - limited areas of the world ; therefore , early detection with the use of this simple , cost - effective , and affordable tool could reduce maternal morbidity and mortality and improve neonatal outcomes.1,2,6 a significant relationship was also observed between shortage of staff and partograph utilization . according to oladapo et al,10 the lack of health care staff is strongly implicated as a factor affecting utilization of the partograph as a labor - monitoring instrument .",
            "other researchers have opined that some midwives consider the time spent in completing the partograph to be unduly wasted as they do not appreciate its contribution in helping the woman in labor.16 by implication , when the number of staff on shift duty is favorable , the higher would be the propensity of them completing the partograph during labor monitoring .",
            "the few providers on duty are overwhelmed with work such that little or no attention is paid to some important and routine professional details .",
            "the present free health care provided to pregnant women and children under the age of 5 years may further compound this issue .",
            "furthermore , it was also observed in this study that previous training had a positive correlation with knowledge of the partograph .",
            "even though many of the participants lacked detailed knowledge of the partograph , the nurses / midwives who had received better formal training were more knowledgeable in the use of the partograph than the chew , nurse aid / orderlies , and jchew .",

            "this situation also holds true in private maternity centers , which are perpetually facing a shortage of trained staff.10,17 evidence has shown that knowledge of partograph use for labor management is very low among nurses , midwives , and generalist doctors working in the primary and secondary health care levels and private health care centers when compared to tertiary level care.9,10,13 this brings to the fore the need to introduce hands - on training for all factions of ocgs who practice at the secondary and primary levels of care and encourage them to be engaged in continued professional educational development .",
            "there was no statistically significant relationship between sex , years of practice , and years of experience with partograph knowledge in this study .",
            "this observation is in accordance with that of engida et al in ethiopia.21 contrary to this observation , opiah et al8 in their study in yenagoa , bayelsa state in the niger delta region of nigeria , reported that there was a significant relationship between years of experience of midwives and the use of the partograph .",
            "the disparity in their study could be accounted for by differences in setting , since theirs was conducted among midwives at the tertiary level and at an academic medical center .",

            "indeed , the analysis of escherichia coli plasmids from bacterial strains isolated before and after the use of antibiotics for therapy demonstrated that the plasmid families were similar , but incorporated resistance genes after the antibiotic era ( datta and hughes , 1983 ) .",

            "recent work indicates that indeed antibiotic - producing environmental microorganisms harbor a large number of resistance genes that could be potentially transferred to human pathogens ( dcosta et al . , 2006 ) .",

            "for instance , the quinolone resistance gene qnra originated in the water - borne bacteria shewanella algae , which is not known to produce an antibiotic ( poirel et al . , 2005 ) .",

            "this indicates that the transfer of a resistance gene from its original host to a human pathogen might be constrained by different bottlenecks , as discussed in this review .",
            "the existence of resistance genes in natural ecosystems , even those without any record of pollution by antibiotics was reported more than four decades ago ( gardner et al . , 1969 )",
            ". however , detailed studies on this topic are more recent . in the last years an increasing number of studies of the presence of resistance genes in non - clinical ecosystems have been published .",
            "briefly , two different methodologies are applied ; one is the search for any potential gene that confers resistance on expression in a heterologous host by using functional genomic techniques ( dcosta et al . , 2006 , 2011 ;",

            "whereas , in the first analysis the purpose is to characterize any gene that can cause resistance if transferred and hence study the potential natural resistome of the studied ecosystem , the second type of study analyses contamination by resistance genes already acquired by human pathogen .",
            "functional metagenomics serves to define novel mechanisms of resistance ( potentiality , see martinez et al . , 2007 ) , but predicting whether such mechanisms will be transferred to human pathogens is not obvious ( see below ) .",
            "indeed , the fact that the origin of the antibiotic resistance genes currently present in human pathogens is known in only a few cases indicates that defining the environmental resistome is a needed but not sufficient condition for predicting the emergence of resistance .",
            "it is important to note however that the finding of novel mechanisms of resistance can be a valuable tool for the design of antibiotic modifications before resistance arises ( wright , 2007 ; martinez et al . , 2011 ) .",
            "the analysis of the presence in different ecosystems ( contaminated and pristine ) of genes that have been already acquired by human pathogens would provide information on the stability of these elements , the reservoirs and the factors that enrich their presence in nature .",

            ". between these types of studies are functional analyses on the resistance mobilome , those resistance genes that are already present on mobile elements , irrespective of whether or not they have been acquired by human pathogens .",
            "the transfer of a potential resistance gene from the chromosome of an environmental bacterium to a human pathogen requires it to be mobilizable after its capture by a translocative element and its integration in an mge .",
            "this means that once the resistance element has been incorporated in a mobile element , the possibility of its acquisition by a human pathogen can be high , especially if this element is present in the human bacterial population .",
            "unfortunately , studies on the environmental resistance mobilome are difficult and still rare ( szczepanowski et al . , 2008 , 2009 ;",
            "the first requirement for the transfer of a resistance gene is that both the donor and the receptor share the same habitat . in the case of pathogenic bacteria ,",
            "the pathogens need not co - exist with the donor , because a chain of microorganisms may link the donor and the recipient .",
            "however , since acquiring resistance genes might confer a fitness cost ( see below ) , the establishment of a successful gene - transfer chain is possible only with positive selection for the resistance determinant . in other words , unless resistance is selected ( mainly by antibiotics ) , it is unlikely that mges containing resistance genes will be fixed in the populations of environmental microorganisms en route to human pathogens .",
            "since the natural concentrations of antibiotics in non - clinical ecosystems are much lower than at hospitals ( davies , 2006 ) , only in the case of pollution by antibiotics ( aquaculture , waste disposal from cities , farms , or industries ) a positive selection for mges containing resistance genes can be envisaged . following this reasoning ,",
            "it has been proposed that the possibility of a given resistance gene being transferred to a human pathogen will largely depend on whether the habitat where the donor micro - organism is present close to human - linked ecosystems ( baquero et al . , 2009 ) .",
            "for instance , it would be rare for resistance genes found in deep soil allocations ( brown and balkwill , 2009 ) or at a glacial ice core ( miteva et al . , 2004 ) would be transferred to human pathogens .",
            "in contrast , it has been suggested that ecosystems such as waste - water treatment plants or farms , where human pathogens and environmental bacteria co - exist in the presence of contaminating antibiotic residues , might be hot - spots for the acquisition of resistance genes by bacterial pathogens ( baquero et al . , 2008 ; aminov , 2011 ) .",
            "for those microorganisms sharing the same ecosystem , some of them are more prone to exchange genetic material than others .",
            "the organisms that can share genes , have been named as genetic exchange communities ( jain et al . , 2003 ) . as stated in ( skippington and ragan , 2011 ) ,  gene exchange communities can vary widely in spatial extent , taxonomic diversity , density of internal connectivity , and involvement of vector types .",
            " these communities usually share some plasmid ( or transposon ) types and do not possess strong restriction / modification systems that would impede the interchange of dna . as a consequence ,",
            "the entrance of a resistance gene , located in a proficient mge into a well established gene exchange community might allow its spread among different organisms and consequently fixation in populations of bacterial pathogens .",
            "this spread will be modulated by specific fitness costs that preclude the stability of the gene in some bacterial species .",
            "by founder effect , we refer to the situation in which the first gene to arrive is the one to win ( baquero et al . , 2009 ) .",
            "when there are several resistance determinants with a similar substrate profile , usually one prevails once transferred to human bacterial pathogens . as we will discuss later , this situation can be the consequence of differential fitness costs , nevertheless , a certain degree of serendipity might be the basis of the successful transfer , spread and fixation of a given resistance determinant .",
            "one example of this situation is the tem-1 beta - lactamase , which , followed by shv-1 and oxa enzymes , has been the predominant plasmid - encoded beta - lactamase in enterobacteriaceae for many years ( simpson et al .",
            ", 1980 ; medeiros , 1997 ) . the tem-1 beta - lactamase was acquired soon after the introduction of the first generation of beta - lactams for therapy , and plasmids coding this beta - lactamase spread rapidly among bacterial pathogens .",
            "the study of several different ecosystems has shown that there exist a large number of beta - lactamases nearly everywhere , which can confer resistance to the same antibiotics as tem-1 .",
            "antibiotic resistance genes are acquired and maintained because of the strong selective pressure of antibiotics .",
            "once bacteria have acquired a determinant that allow them to resist antibiotics , there is not a selection pressure for replacement of the determinant already present in bacterial populations .",
            "this situation can change if the selective pressure is altered , for example when new antibiotics are launched into clinical use ( livermore , 2009 ; salverda et al . ,",
            "the introduction of beta - lactamase inhibitors and novel beta - lactams for which tem-1 presented low activity generated two different processes : ( i ) evolution of the tem - enzyme that most likely occurred in clinical settings when bacterial pathogens were exposed to the novel selective pressure ( ii ) acquisition of novel beta - lactamase coding genes by human pathogens with novel substrate profiles .",
            "it is generally assumed that the acquisition of an antibiotic resistance determinant confers a fitness cost ( andersson and levin , 1999 ) , meaning that in the absence of selection , resistant bacteria will be outcompeted by the susceptible ones . in the case of genes acquired by hgt",
            ", these costs might be the consequence of the metabolic load imposed by the replication , transcription , and translation of the novel genetic elements . if this was the unique cause of fitness costs , the disadvantage of carrying one or another resistance gene will be similar and the fitness cost would not constitute a relevant bottleneck in selecting one resistance determinant over another .",
            "however , different studies have shown that , at least on occasion , the introduction of a given resistance gene does not impose a non - specific metabolic burden but leads to specific changes in bacterial physiology .",
            "this may be the case for ampc beta - lactamase genes , which are infrequently found on salmonella plasmids unless the plasmid also harbors the repressor of their expression ( verdet et al . , 2000 ) or elements that compensate the biological costs associated to ampc expression ( hossain et al . , 2004 ) .",
            "it has been found that ampc alters the physiology of salmonella , decreasing its virulence and hence a differential fitness cost that decreases the probability of dissemination of specific gene among salmonella strains ( morosini et al . , 2000 ) .",
            "this example indicates that the fitness costs can be gene - specific and do not necessarily derive from a general metabolic burden . in this context ,",
            "those resistance determinants conferring high fitness costs are unlikely to be fixed in bacterial populations because they would be outcompeted by other resistance determinants which lower fitness costs ( martinez et al . , 2011 ) .",
            "this reasoning must be however modified by the chances of acquiring compensatory mutations ( andersson and hughes , 2011 ; martinez et al . , 2011 ) .",
            "if a resistance determinant confers high fitness costs , but compensatory mutations are easily selected , the probability of being maintained in bacterial pathogens is high . in such cases ,",
            "if the compensatory mutations occur in the chromosome , not in the mge , the acquisition of the resistance gene by a new host implies a new fitness cost , and as a consequence the spread of the resistance determinant will be compromised .",
            "however , it the mutation occurs in the mge , the chances for spread will be enhanced .",
            "if the acquisition of resistance confers fitness costs it is logical to suppose that resistant organisms will be outcompeted by their susceptible , fitter counterparts in the absence of selection .",
            "however , some resistant strains present no - cost ( rozen et al . , 2007 ; balsalobre and de la campa , 2008 ) and even some resistance determinants can be beneficial under certain conditions ( alonso et al . , 2004 ;",
            "maughan et al . , 2004 ; luo et al . , 2005 ; perkins and nicholson , 2008 ; michon et al . ,",
            "finally , some fitness costs can be compensated by mutations that do not impede to keep resistance ( bjorkman et al . , 1998 ;",
            ", 2002 ; paulander et al . , 2007 ; lind et al . , 2010 ; shcherbakov et al . ,",
            "this indicates that reversing resistance once established can be a difficult task ( andersson and hughes , 2010 ) .",
            "maintenance of resistance genes in habitats without a strong antibiotic pressure is favored as well by second - order selection processes .",
            "this means that the selection for one antibiotic will select for the whole array of resistance genes present in this specific mge .",
            "furthermore , mges besides resistance genes may carry other elements such as heavy - metal resistance determinants ( baker - austin et al . , 2006 ) , or genes coding for production of siderophores , toxins , or bacteriocins ( de lorenzo and martinez , 1988 ; clewell , 1990 ; herrero et al . , 2008",
            ") ; these can confer an ecological advantage in some ecosystems and thus co - select resistance in the absence of antibiotics .",
            "cross - selection might also be a relevant second - order process that allows maintenance of resistance in the absence of selection .",
            "certain resistance determinants , such as multidrug ( mdr ) efflux pumps confer resistance to different compounds ( antibiotics , biocides , or heavy metals ; martinez et al . , 2009b ) .",
            "this means that selection with the biocide or the heavy metal might result in cross - resistance to the antibiotic ( hernandez et al .",
            "a final mechanism for the maintenance of resistance is based on the inherent systems for plasmid stability .",
            "plasmids frequently encode toxin / antitoxin systems , which provoke death of bacteria that lose the plasmid ( hayes , 2003 ; hayes and van melderen , 2011 ) .",
            "if one such plasmid incorporates an antibiotic resistance determinant , the probabilities for its maintenance will be high .",
            "taking these considerations into account , resistance genes might evade elimination ( andersson and hughes , 2011 ) in the absence of antibiotics ; indeed , resistance determinants present in human pathogens have been found on identical mges , in antibiotic - pristine habitats ( pallecchi et al .",
            "livermore et al . , 2001 ) and primitive human populations without any known exposure to antibiotics ( grenet et al . , 2004 ; bartoloni et al . ,",

            "another possible but unlikely explanation for the lack of effect of zinc supplementation on serum zinc levels may be that the dose of zinc used was insufficient ; we used a dose that was twice the rda .",

            "this is possible since secretory parasite molecules pass through the pvm into the host cell cytoplasm , where they interact with and manipulate host cell functions .",

            "in this study , we compared the capacities of three inbred mouse strains expressing different mhc - i molecules to cope with a n. caninum infection .",
            "significant differences in the responses to n. caninum infection in inbred and outbred mice have been demonstrated previously , and these differences have been postulated to be due to varying abilities to present n. caninum antigens on their mhc molecules .",
            "when using mouse models to investigate the outcome and immunological parameters of infection , the selection of the n. caninum isolate as well as inoculum doses are important variables that will influence the results .",
            "the present study showed high variations in morbidity and mortality in the three inbred mouse strains balb / c , cba / ca , and c57bl/6 after inoculation with different numbers of n. caninum ( nc - liv ) tachyzoites , demonstrating that the choice of mouse strain plays a crucial role for the assessment of experimental infections and agents that could potentially interfere therein .   while balb / c mice did not suffer from clinical signs of neosporosis after a challenge dose of 1  10  n. caninum tachyzoites , infection with 5  10 tachyzoites resulted in severe clinical symptoms starting at day 20 pi .",
            "this is in accordance with several vaccination studies , which have used the balb / c and c57bl/6 models to investigate the protective effects of vaccine candidates ( reviewed in   ) .",
            "in contrast , only limited research has been performed using cba / ca mice as a model to investigate the immune responses against n. caninum infection .",
            "our investigations demonstrated that this mouse strain is clearly more resistant against neosporosis compared to balb / c and c57bl/6 mice .",
            "previously , these features of cba / ca mice with regard to n. caninum infection had been highlighted by rettigner et al .",
            ", who described this mouse strain to be resistant against an infection of 5  10 tachyzoites of the nc-1 isolate of n. caninum following treatment with immunosuppressing agents and suitable for the generation of cerebral tissue cysts .",
            "this is surprising , since the nc-1 isolate , in contrast to nc - liv , does hardly convert into bradyzoites under in vitro conditions such as high ph treatment or incubation with sodium nitroprusside   . with respect to c57bl/6 mice , ramamoorthy et al",
            ".   observed no clinical signs of neosporosis throughout an observation period of 21 days after an infection with 5  10  nc-1 tachyzoites but also showed these mice to be highly susceptible to an infection with 2  10 nc-1 tachyzoites .",
            "others failed to observe clinical signs in c57bl/6 mice after a challenge with 5  10  nc-1 tachyzoites as long as 44 days pi . in this study , after a challenge dose of 1  10  nc - liv tachyzoites disease symptoms occurred after 26 days but only after 8 days when 5  10 tachyzoites were inoculated , with three out of five mice succumbing to infection .",
            "this illustrates that , besides the mouse strain used , the selection of the neospora isolate also makes a big difference . in any case , an infection dose of 25  10 tachyzoites of the nc - liv isolate was far too high for any of the mouse strains to cope with , requiring euthanasia of all but one mouse between days 712 pi .  ",
            "since n. caninum is an intracellular parasite , the protective immune response is likely to involve cell - mediated immunity ; thus th1-mediated responses are important .",
            "however , in balb / c mice it has been demonstrated that besides cellular immunity also humoral immune responses are crucial in controlling n. caninum infection and limiting the pathological changes caused by an excessive proinflammatory response   .",
            "teixeira et al .   described that intraperitoneal injection of n. caninum tachyzoites ( nc-1 isolate ) in balb / c mice induced a parasite - specific , nonpolyclonal , b - cell response .",
            "a strong bias towards a th2-type response resulted in increased susceptibility to n. caninum and enhanced the corresponding pathologic effects .",
            "however , vaccination of mice with recombinant rhoptry antigen rop2 emulsified in saponin adjuvants induced an igg1-biased humoral immune response , while formulating the same antigen in freund 's incomplete adjuvants resulted in an igg2a - biased antibody response , and both were protective in the nonpregnant balb / c mouse model .",
            "protection associated with an igg2a - biased humoral immune response was also demonstrated for recombinant protein disulfide isomerase applied for vaccination intranasally   .",
            "vaccination of mice with native ncsrs2 induced a th2-biased protective response that reduced congenital infection of offspring balb / c mice .",
            "reduction in congenital infection , also associated with a th2-biased immune response , was demonstrated by vaccination experiments in balb / c mice employing combined ncmic1 , ncmic3 , and ncrop2 antigens . taken together , it is probably rather a suitable balance in th1/th2-type immune responses than a strict th1 response that allows the host to deal with n. caninum infection .  ",
            "similar to earlier studies in balb / c mice   , levels of igg1 antibodies in animals infected with 1  10 and 5  10 tachyzoites were generally high , and it is interesting to note that a challenge dose of 5  10 tachyzoites in balb / c mice resulted in more pronounced igg1 responses compared to the igg1 antibody levels found in mice inoculated with 1  10 tachyzoites , while igg2a titres were basically equal in both groups . in the balb / c mice inoculated with 5  10 tachyzoites , titres for igg1 and igg2a were similar , which is in agreement with previous observations reported by lundn et al . .",
            "in addition , we found that splenocytes obtained from balb / c mice inoculated with 5  10 tachyzoites and stimulated with n. caninum antigen produced ifn- , albeit at a lower level compared to cba / ca mice .",
            "the results of rettigner et al .   on n. caninum infection in cba / ca mice showed no evidence of differential isotype secretion but a high expression of ifn- , while in our experiments sera of infected cba / ca mice exhibited a high igg2a response , and splenocytes of cba / ca mice infected with 1  10  n. caninum tachyzoites also secreted high levels of ifn-. this indicated that the induction of a cellular immune response is a prerequisite for successful dealing with the infection .",
            "the importance of the humoral immune response during n. caninum infection was demonstrated by eperon et al .   who showed increased susceptibility to n. caninum ( nc-1 isolate ) infection in mt b - cell - deficient mice when compared to wild - type c57bl/6 mice .",
            "they also described the predominant presence of parasite - specific igg2a isotypes and an absence of igg1 isotypes in c57bl/6 mice at various time points .",
            ", we did not observe any igg2a antibody titres in c57bl/6 mice and analysed the igg2c antibody isotype levels instead .",
            "our results showed the major parasite - specific igg isotype to be igg2c . in agreement with a shift from a th1- to a th2-biased response , increasing titres of n. caninum - specific igg1 were detected in mice sera collected at later time points after infection .",
            "while n. caninum obviously induces differential humoral and cellular immune responses in different mouse strains during the acute phase of infection , one could imagine that chronic infection would be characterized by the production of tissue cysts .",
            "therefore , in order to mimic the infection in cattle , a mouse model able to form tissue cysts , and also exhibiting recrudescence during pregnancy , is required .",
            "however , only few reports have actually been published on the production of n. caninum tissue cysts in mice .",
            "tissue cyst production had been demonstrated in outbred mice and immunosuppressed cba / ca mice inoculated with nc-1 or nc - liv tachyzoites but not all of the mice investigated harboured cerebral tissue cysts and",
            "rettigner et al .   showed that immunosuppressed female cba / ca mice given 5  10  nc-1 tachyzoites were able to survive and to consistently develop cerebral tissue cysts .",
            "more recently , tissue cyst production , marked by positive staining with an antibody directed against the toxoplasma bradyzoite antigen bag5 , has also been demonstrated in an experimentally infected carnivorous marsupial , the fat - tailed dunnart sminthopsis crassicaudata .",
            "it is also very likely that n. caninum tissue cysts are not necessarily formed predominantly in the cns but also at other locations such as muscle tissue   , and this should be taken into account in future studies .   in conclusion , we comparatively assessed balb / c , cba / ca , and c57bl/6 mice as models for n. caninum infection and demonstrated that cba / ca mice exhibited the highest degree of resistance at low and medium infection doses but rapidly developed acute signs of neosporosis when challenged with the highest dose of n. caninum nc - liv tachyzoites .",
            "this mice strain has previously been shown to be suitable for tissue cyst production , which renders them an interesting model for investigations on protective effects and potential tools for vaccination .",
            "in contrast , the use of balb / c mice , although extensively employed , is debatable due to their inherent th2 bias , resulting in increased susceptibility to n. caninum .",
            "thus , there is clearly a need for a standardisation of experimental murine infection models for n. caninum in order to achieve comparable results between research groups that work with different tools for immunoprevention and chemotherapy ."

            "interaction of crp with fc - gamma receptors ( fcr ) fcri and fcriia is known to promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines , resulting in the amplification loop of inflammatory reaction .",
            "these processes are initiated through the induction of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-b ligand ( rankl ) protein and direct stimulation of osteoclastogenesis , causing a loop between inflammation and bone destruction in ra .",
            "crp enhances both the proinflammatory response and bone destruction . in the treatment of ra , a lowered crp level thus not only is a significant parameter in terms of disease progression elimination but also has a direct impact on decreasing the degree of bone destruction .",

            "the enzyme 5-lox catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes , whose production has been associated with inflammation in arthritis .",
            "suppression of 5-lox expression ameliorates clinical parameters in ra and aa   .",
            "increased levels of nf-b in the lung and liver as well as increased activity of lox in the lung highlight the importance of extra - articular manifestations of aa . in our experiment ,",

            "thus the anti - inflammatory effect of n - f-5ht in aa was supported by the ability of the molecule to inhibit 12/15-lox activity . similar to this result , recent observations also reported that several other flavonoids may act as lox inhibitors . in aa ,",

            "also , in our study , the levels of tnf- and inos mrna expressions were significantly increased in arthritic animals ( both p < 0.001 , aa versus co ; figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) )",
            ". it was proposed that these modifications in the liver of arthritic rats not only were a consequence of the metabolic alterations caused by the disease , especially the increased oxidative metabolism , but also depended on increased inflammatory parameters in the liver .",
            "the same agents that increase oxidative metabolism , tnf- , il-1 , il-6 , and others , are responsible for increasing the activity of inos in several tissues .",
            "an increase of inos activity as a consequence of elevated inos mrna expression was considered to play a dominant role in the pathogenesis of ra .",
            "no generation by inos induced in chondrocytes in the initial stage of aa may play a key role in triggering the subsequent events in arthritis . in general , the use of nos inhibitors has been shown to exert beneficial effects in experimentally induced arthritis . however ,",
            "which types of cells expressing inos are associated with the induction or progression of adjuvant - induced arthritis via no generation remains uncertain .",
            "mrna expression of inos in rat liver was reduced following mtx ( aa - mtx versus aa , p < 0.001 ; figure 2(a ) ) and n - f-5ht treatment ( aa - n - f-5ht versus aa , p < 0.01 ; figure 2(a ) ) .",
            "the effect of mtx treatment on tnf- protein and mrna expression differs among studies , depending on the conditions of the given study , concerning gender of patients , type of cell line , duration of treatment , mtx dose , and so forth . in our study in the rat aa model , administration of mtx",
            "attenuated significantly the mrna expression of tnf- ( aa - mtx versus aa , p < 0.01 ; figure 2(b ) ) . in many patients , however , mtx treatment does not result in lower tnf- plasma concentration .",
            "when mtx fails to produce an adequate response , newer therapies are used in combination with mtx .",
            "blocking tnf- with anti - tnf- monoclonal antibodies significantly decreased the signs and symptoms of ra compared to placebo in ra patients with active disease receiving mtx   .",
            "thus , the n - f-5ht - driven significant reduction of tnf- mrna expression ( a - n - f-5ht versus aa , p < 0.01 ; figure 2(b ) ) suggests an intriguing effect on ra treatment , calling for deeper investigation .",
            "increase of mrna expression was observed for il-1 in the liver of arthritic animals ( aa versus co , p < 0.001 ; figure 3(a ) ) as expected .",
            "administration of mtx did not lead to significant attenuation of il-1 transcription in the liver .",
            "this is in concert with previous studies of mtx function in different types of cells ( e.g. , human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine peritoneal and splenic cells )   . on the other hand",
            ", mtx exhibits another mechanism of il-1 function inhibition , which involves blocking the binding of il-1 to il-1 receptor in the membrane of peripheral blood cells ( monocytes , lymphocytes , and granulocytes ) .",
            "contrary to mtx , treatment with n - f-5ht led to a substantial inhibition of il-1 gene expression ( aa - n - f-5ht versus aa , p < 0.01 ; figure 3(a ) ) .",
            "further , we examined il-1 mrna expression in the main immunocompetent organ , in the rat arthritic spleen , which has not been studied previously in terms of the aa model , related to il-1 expression .",
            "we observed il-1 mrna expression activation comparable to that in the liver ( aa versus co , p < 0.001 ; figure 3(b ) ) .",
            "interestingly , both mtx and n - f-5ht exhibited a significant and remarkably stronger inhibition of il-1 mrna expression in comparison to that in the liver ( aa - mtx versus aa , p < 0.01 ; aa - n - f-5ht versus aa , p < 0.001 ; figure 3(b ) ) .",
            "in the spleen of n - f-5ht treated rats , the relative mrna expression decreased even to control level .",
            "besides other events , mtx treatment leads to suppression of nf-b , a heterodimer consisting of two subunits p65 and p50 , one of the most prominent inflammatory transcription factors activated in ra .",
            "this was confirmed in our previous work , along with the finding that also n - f-5ht ( 15  mg / kg ) suppressed the activation of nf-b ( p65 ) in the arthritic rat liver   .",
            "interestingly , combination therapy ( mtx + n - f-5ht ) potentiated the effect of a single drug , suggesting different mechanisms leading to nf-b inhibition .",
            "mtx driven reduction of cytokine transcription was attributed to abrogation of ib kinase activation and thereby suppression of ib ( nf-b inhibitor ) phosphorylation and degradation , resulting in retaining the inactive nf-b form in cytoplasm .",
            "however , the contribution of n - f-5ht to nf-b pathway suppression needs to be further investigated .",
            "studies of the proposed pathways involved in the transcription of tnf- , il-1 , and inos in ra could help evaluate the mechanism of action of these drugs   .",
            "the gene expression of inos is mostly under the control of synergistically activating nf-b ( il-1 and tnf- stimulated ) and stat1 ( ifn- stimulated ) key proinflammatory signals in the liver .",
            "in contrast to inos , tnf- does not contain the stat binding element in its promoter region .",
            "the inhibition of tnf- and inos transcription observed in our study might be mostly attributed to the suppressed nf-b pathway for both mtx and n - f-5ht   .",
            "however , the contribution of ap-1 to tnf- and stat1 for inos can not be excluded .",
            "mtx - dependent suppression of nf-b was reported   , but in other cases mtx was not found to be effective in the attenuation of arthritic - increased mrna expression of il-1   . taking into account our results , where mtx treatment did not lead to inhibition of il-1 mrna expression in the arthritic liver in contrast to the significant n - f-5ht impact , yet treatment of both mtx and n - f-5ht decreased the presumably nf-b - dependent lox activity and inos and tnf- transcription to a similar extent , the involvement of n - f-5ht in another pathway for transcription regulation of this cytokine in the arthritic liver should be considered .",
            "after analysis of the reported pathways involved in the regulation of il-1 mrna expression , we hypothesized that tnf--driven ap-1 transcription factor activation or jak / stat3 pathway activated via il-6 or ifn- might play a role (   , figure s1 in supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/7509653 ) .",
            "papers reporting involvement of other polyphenols in anti - inflammatory regulation , for example , resveratrol , claim that these compounds exhibit their anti - inflammatory effect through suppression of nf-b and jak / stat signaling pathways   .",
            "the enhanced influence of mtx and n - f-5ht on il-1 transcription in the spleen in comparison to the liver may be the consequence of different predominance of inflammatory pathways in this organ , presumably with a stronger nf-b contribution .",
            "details about the relevance of these pathways and the role of n - f-5ht in the transcription regulation of il-1 , inos , and tnf- in the liver and other organs in ra are to be further elucidated .",
            "the present study contributed additional evidence about the beneficial effect and mechanism of action of n - f-5ht and of mtx on a systemic inflammatory process in the liver and its association with the pathogenesis of adjuvant arthritis .",
            "n - f-5ht treatment led to amelioration of inflammatory parameters tested ( plasmatic crp and il-1 protein levels , liver lox activity , and liver and spleen cytokine expression ) .",
            "however , this did not result in a significant change of hpv , although a trend of improvement of the arthritic score was observed after 28 days .",
            "a synergistic effect of tnf- and il-1 was shown to influence the balance between protein degradation and protein synthesis causing among others an increase in resting energy expenditure and net efflux of amino acids from muscle to liver .",
            "the significant increase of bwc in n - f-5ht treated rats , probably sign of the partial improvement of rheumatoid cachexia , might be the result of lowered mrna expression of tnf- and il-1 determined in the arthritic liver . moreover , taking into account the reported association of weight loss with the il-1 production by splenic cells , the n - f-5ht mediated attenuation of increased il-1 mrna expression in the arthritic spleen might contribute to this complex process",
            ". the contribution of the affected expression of tnf- and il-1 originating from other organs can not be excluded and is to be further elucidated .",
            "unexpectedly , chronic daily treatment with a high concentration of n - f-5ht ( 30  mg / kg ) exhibited either a minor effect on the parameters examined and/or a strong variation among the animals ( not shown ) and that in contrast to a much lower concentration ( 3  mg / kg ) . since n - f-5ht possesses a serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-ht ) moiety , the question if there might be some interplay between effects of these two molecules on ra pathogenesis is to be raised . since n - f-5ht inhibited the increase of cytosolic free ca concentration in rat vascular smooth muscle cells induced by serotonin mediated by 5-ht2 receptors , it was hypothesized that at a sufficient concentration n - f-5ht may act as a competitive antagonist , which displaces serotonin from its binding site .",
            "intake of a high concentration of a 5-ht2 receptor antagonist may lead to a variety of effects : it may influence the receptor density , even enhance the effect of serotonin , or lead to desensitization and with time to receptor resistance ( through inhibitory feedback due to binding - induced enhanced production of serotonin ) .",
            "interestingly , serotonin is known not only as a neurotransmitter . increasing but contradictory reports associate serotonin with immunoinflammatory pathways in the periphery .",
            "serotonin , via its 5-ht2a , 5-ht2b , and 5-ht3 receptors , has been implicated to have both proinflammatory and anti - inflammatory roles in a number of studies of rheumatoid arthritis   .",
            "the reported effects of 5-ht receptor antagonist on macrophage - like synovial cells encourage the interest to study the effect of n - f-5ht from this point of view . to confirm this hypothesis ,",
            "a precise characterization of interaction between n - f-5ht and 5-ht receptors is to be done . on comparing the effects of the two drugs , administration of mtx ( 0.4 ",
            "mg / kg ) or n - f-5ht ( 3  mg / kg ) was found to lead to a decrease of the main plasma marker of systemic inflammation crp , the liver origin protein , and to inhibition of proinflammatory lox in the liver .",
            "the impact of mtx and n - f-5ht on mrna expression of tnf- , il-1 , and inos in the liver and on the level of crp in plasma was mentioned at the conference .",
            "mtx and n - f-5ht reduced the arthritis - increased transcription of tnf- and inos in the liver to a comparable extent . we suppose that the inhibition of tnf- and inos transcription might be mostly attributed to the suppressed nf-b pathway for the two drugs   .",
            "as previously reported   and also proven by our study , mtx was not able to diminish the arthritic - induced il-1 mrna transcription in the liver .",
            "this handicap might be compensated by coadministration of n - f-5ht , since this drug was shown to lower the level of proinflammatory cytokine il-1 in plasma in the acute phase of aa and to attenuate significantly the elevation of il-1 mrna expression in the arthritic rat liver and spleen in the chronic phase .",
            "detailed studies are required to confirm the hypothesis that n - f-5ht might function through potentially different mechanisms of inhibition of the inflammatory pathway nf-b and not through mtx , as well as the possibility of an additional pathway influencing il-1 transcription under control of n - f-5ht but not mtx .",
            "the confirmation would support n - f-5ht as a promising agent for the treatment of ra in combination therapy with mtx .",
            "the positive effect was shown in our previous study , where n - f-5ht markedly potentiated the therapeutic effect of low - dose mtx .",
            "as the therapeutic dose of mtx was used in this study and the purpose of combination study is to lower the mtx dose to decrease the side effects of this drug , the effect of combination therapy was not included",
            ". oral daily intake of n - f-5ht could overcome the inconvenient administration and high costs of biological therapy using il-1 monoclonal antibody , which was shown in clinical trials to be superior to placebo in combination with mtx in reducing signs , symptoms , and radiographic progression in patients with advanced ra   .",
            "future studies of n - f-5ht mechanisms of action should shed more light on the immunomodulatory function of this natural polyphenol .",
            "it is to be expected that n - f-5ht is able to positively affect the activity of other markers of inflammation and oxidative stress not only in the liver and spleen but also in other organs ( lung , brain , etc . ) , a hypothesis to be tested by future work .",

            "this is because psychological distress often refers to both the symptoms of psychiatric disorders and emotional responses to adversity and it is sometimes used as a screening for measure of probable psychiatric morbidity . despite being contiguous with psychological distress , emotional pain ( psychological pain or psychache ) is more indicative of a sustained state of inner turmoil , a perception of negative changes in the self and its functions that are accompanied by negative feelings .",
            "this pain is deeper and more vicious than depression , although depression may be present as well .",
            "for instance , it is known that patients who experience emotional pain or bodily ache without identifiable and adequate physical causes may be symbolically experiencing an intra - psychic conflict or psychological disorder .  ",

            "for instance , existing literature suggest that recognizable psychopathology is seen in about 30% of patients attending dental clinics with complaints of distress or pain , and this often goes undetected and untreated . early and appropriate recognition of such psychological distress would benefit both the individual patient and health care providers .",

            "therefore , findings in this study constitute an important contribution to knowledge on the emotional concerns of dental patients in order to improve the quality of care in dental setting . in this study ,",
            "the burden of psychological distress among dental patients ( 21.8% ) was about three folds higher than what is found in the control group ( 7% ) .",
            "this high prevalence of distress among dental patients , as observed in this study , is not only in keep with what has been fielded in earlier works , but can be attributed to the experience of varieties of psychopathologies by dental patients .",

            "the disparity in the burden of emotional distress in the cited studies and our study can be adjudged to several factors like methodological issues , study population and setting , clinical factors , personality traits and the extent of comorbidity of mental health disorders among others . to further buttress the importance of the roles of psychosocial factors on emotional well - being among dental patients , improved understanding of dental procedures and expectations",
            "have been associated with reduction in dental fear , while a female gender , low engagement in treatment and depressed mood tend to increase the occurrence of dental fear .",

            "that said , it is interesting to note that psych ache , which is often a feature of depressive illness , was found to exist among more than one - third of the test subjects , out of which only a half had scores suggestive of psychological distress on ghq-12 .",
            "this is postulated to suggest that while ghq may be useful in screening for all forms of psychological distress , the pas is more specific to chronic pain .",

            "as only 1 patient showed classic hypsarrhythmia , the cohort may have some fundamental differences from other studies of infantile spasms in which hypsarrhythmia is essential for inclusion .",
            "we identified 3 truncating mutations : 1 occurred de novo and the remaining 2 were inherited .",
            "this is in keeping with previous reports in which the overwhelming majority of pathogenic depdc5 mutations resulted in premature truncation of the protein ( figure 2 ) , suggesting that depdc5 mutations cause disease by haploinsufficiency of the protein .",

            "however , we report 2 missense variants , pro1031his ( maf 0.7% ) and tyr281phe ( maf 0.007% ) , and there are more than 400 missense variants in exac .",
            "tyr281phe is exceedingly rare , and incomplete penetrance of depdc5 mutations may explain the presence of these variants in the population .",
            "however , the 0.7% maf of pro1031his ( arose de novo in family c ) seems too high in this population to be explained solely by incomplete penetrance , and this result needs to be interpreted with caution .",
            "this may also be true for several reported missense mutations also present in controls at low frequencies ( figure 2 )",
            ". it will be important to develop robust functional experiments to assess the pathogenicity of these missense variants in the future .",
            "we have combined a targeted resequencing approach in 130 patients and results from clinical diagnostics and extended phenotyping in a known mutation - positive family to determine several notable features that highlight the variability of onset and outcome of depdc5-associated spasms .",
            "our findings expand the depdc5 phenotypic spectrum to include more severe epilepsies presenting with spasms .",
            "first , the outcome may be excellent with normal intellect , although most of our patients had intellectual disability with or without autistic features .",
            "third , 1 patient had later onset of spasms in the third year with further cognitive decline in adolescence .",
            "fourth , 2 patients had malformations with fcd ; in 1 , surgery resulted in seizure improvement .",
            "surprisingly , only 1 patient showed hypsarrhythmia on eeg ; however , all had highly abnormal eegs with abundant epileptiform activity , which can be associated with epileptic spasms .",
            "the absence of classic hypsarrhythmia means that these patients differ from those with west syndrome , which has been the focus of many recent genomic studies . of note",
            ", spasms were present in patients with fcd ( 2 patients ) and those without fcd ( 3 patients ) after careful scrutiny of the mri .",
            "because many patients with focal epilepsies and depdc5 mutations have normal mri , the presence of detectable lesions is not necessary for the development of seizures .",
            "rather , loss - of - function mutations in depdc5 , an inhibitor of the mtor pathway , presumably lead to excessive signaling of this pathway , which has many functions that could conceivably contribute to hyperexcitability .",
            "this scenario would be analogous to tsc , in which a second mutation in the mtor regulators tsc1 and tsc2 is reported in some tumors of patients with tsc . in patients with depdc5 mutations ,",
            "second hit  could occur either on the other allele or on another gene involved in the mtor pathway .",

            "deep targeted or even whole - exome sequencing should be performed on resected tissue to explore this hypothesis .",
            "given the incomplete penetrance of depdc5 mutations and the discovery of both inherited and de novo mutations , molecular approaches for epileptic spasms should interrogate both inheritance patterns .",

            "finally , aggravating these already serious consequences , infected individuals may spread multidrug - resistant bacteria , thus inflicting harm on other individuals and increasing the economic cost to society .",

            "building on this account , it will be argued that the status quo is inefficient .",
            "next , an approach will be outlined which can be used to determine whether strategies to prevent or to reduce infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria provide a net benefit to society . in order to be able to implement a strategy that has been shown to be advantageous in this sense ,",

            "furthermore , the range of effects which need to be taken into account will depend on the perspective of the analysis . more specifically , while the ( in-)efficiency of the status quo or of an intervention can only be evaluated from the perspective of society , the issue of ( in-)appropriate incentives must be judged from the individual perspective .   first , it is helpful to distinguish three types of costs .",
            "direct costs represent the monetary value of resource utilization that takes place due to the production and consumption of health care .",

            "finally , intangible costs capture the loss in utility or welfare for the patient which results from a reduction in her health status ( including death ) . in comparison with the other two types , intangible costs are more difficult to measure because it is necessary to develop a valuation from scratch .",
            "intangible costs can be measured either in monetary units ( i.e. , as willingness - to - pay ) or in other units such as quality - adjusted life years ( qalys ) .",
            "next , strategies which aim to prevent infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria or to control their impact will usually involve a reduction in the associated costs . relying on a similar categorization as on the cost side",
            ", these benefits may turn up either as direct benefits , or as indirect benefits , or finally as intangible benefits . whereas direct benefits ( or indirect benefits ) accrue as reductions in direct costs ( or indirect costs ) , intangible benefits arise from improvements in health status or an extension of length of life . from the individual perspective of an economic unit such as , e.g. , a physician , an insurer , or a patient",
            ", it makes sense to take into account only those costs and benefits which accrue to the unit itself .",

            "hence , a decision is rational from the perspective of society , or efficient for short , if it maximizes the net benefit that accrues to society . otherwise , it is inefficient and it is at least possible to make everyone better off by moving to an efficient decision .",
            "it is important to realize that both the perspectives are necessary to explain why inefficient decisions involving a waste of resources are taken and how they can be improved upon . according to a basic assumption that will also be imposed below",
            ", economic units always act individually rational , i.e. , they always maximize their own net benefit .",
            "simple though it is , this assumption nevertheless can be quite helpful in explaining inefficient decisions .",
            "more precisely , such decisions are likely to occur whenever the associated costs and benefits do not fall exclusively on the unit who takes them .  ",
            "e.g. , patients infected with multidrug - resistant bacteria are likely to receive inefficient health care if the providers have no incentive to take into account all the costs and benefits associated with the treatment they provide . applying the societal perspective",

            "individuals who are colonized with multidrug - resistant bacteria but not yet infected usually do not suffer from any immediate consequences . however , there are substantial risks involving serious medical problems and economic costs , both for the individuals themselves as well as for other individuals who get in touch with them .",

            ", care must be taken to make sure that promising strategies will also be implemented by the relevant actors . applying both steps in a systematic manner regularly and based on appropriate empirical data to check available strategies to prevent or control infections , one obtains a management of multidrug - resistant bacteria .",

            "strategies that confer a net benefit to society improve on the current provision of health care and contribute to attaining the goal of an efficient management .",
            "observe that the term strategy is defined in a narrow sense : in particular , it refers to a specific group of patients receiving care from a specific provider at a specific place .",
            "thus , if the benefits of , e.g. , a screening strategy exceed the associated costs , it is nevertheless possible that a further modification , for example by focusing on a different group of patients , may provide an ever higher net benefit to society .",
            "there are good reasons to tackle these tasks within a regional management of multidrug - resistant bacteria .",
            "as its name suggests , a regional management has a clear focus on a specific region but implies no further restrictions otherwise .",
            "thus , it represents a comprehensive approach which is not confined to a single branch of the health care system . furthermore , in view of the problems outlined above it seems necessary to adopt a regional management because such an approach offers a unique opportunity to apply the perspective of society to strategies to prevent or control infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria .",
            "this includes the setup and the continuous maintenance of a database relating to multidrug - resistant bacteria in order to record the prevalences of colonized individuals or infected patients as well as other relevant data .",
            "a major objective would be to take into account the entire process of the development and also the spread of colonization and infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria . in some contrast to the prevailing approach with its focus on hospitals and on the control of infections , a regional management offers the prospect to recognize both the contribution of other health care providers and of strategies to prevent infections in order to deal with infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria in a manner that provides a maximum net benefit to society .",
            "at present , a major problem is that appropriate data on the costs of colonization with multidrug - resistant bacteria are not available . to be sure ,",
            "nevertheless , there are still no or at least no systematic data on some of the cost effects explained above . referring to infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria ,",
            "this is true for the direct costs outside of hospitals as well as for the intangible costs due to a reduction in length of life or a deterioration of health status .",
            "in addition , there is no evidence on the probabilities with which colonized individuals develop an infection or cause other individuals either to be colonized or infected with multidrug - resistant bacteria .",
            "these data would need to be collected with respect to the type of bacteria ( pathogen ) and possibly also with respect to individual attributes such as , e.g. , age or prevailing chronic diseases .",
            "note that the lack of data on some important cost effects also has further implications . since the benefits of strategies to prevent or control infections arise primarily as reductions in the direct , indirect or intangible costs of multidrug - resistant bacteria , the full benefits to society are not known either . more specifically",
            ", there is a lack of data on the impact of efforts to prevent infections , and also on the valuation of the corresponding health effects by the affected individuals . in order to explain the present scale of infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria in germany , it is necessary to investigate the incentives of health care providers to employ strategies to prevent or control infections .",
            "consider a health care provider who applies a screening test to patients deemed at risk such that patients will be isolated until the result becomes available and will be sanified if the test yields a positive result . in many instances , for the provider",
            "this means incurring a certain cost with the prospect of only a small expected benefit : first , the remuneration may be insufficient ( perhaps even nil ) and/or the strategy may not generate enough cost savings for the provider .",
            "the latter reason applies , e.g. , to ambulatory physicians because the higher cost of treatment due to an infection will occur primarily in hospitals .",
            "furthermore , the additional benefits due to averted infections of other individuals will have no direct effect on the provider under consideration either .",
            "a similar statement applies to the careful and cautious therapy with antibiotics which may also contain the development and the spread of multidrug - resistant bacteria : again , the cost falls primarily upon the prescribing physician whereas the benefit turns up elsewhere in society . even though it is not possible currently to describe the economic impact of colonization with multidrug - resistant bacteria in full , the lack of sufficiently strong incentives for health care providers",
            "can safely be taken to imply that too little effort is devoted to the prevention or the control of infections . as a gauge ,",
            "consider the costs and benefits to society of strategies to prevent or control infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria : as argued above , health care providers implementing such strategies will usually reap only part of the associated benefit while bearing the full cost .",
            "therefore , the incentives facing health care providers are too weak to induce them to provide efficient care with respect to the protection from infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria . in turn",
            ", this implies that , from the perspective of society , there will be too many infections imposing an overall cost that is unnecessarily high .   if a strategy to prevent infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria conferring a net benefit to society has been identified , the next task is to make sure that it will be implemented .",
            "in essence , this means setting appropriate incentives : the net benefit to society needs to be distributed among the relevant actors in a manner such that it is individually rational for everybody to apply the strategy .",
            "more specifically , this implies an appropriate remuneration of health care providers , covering at least their own cost due to the effort to prevent or control infections with multidrug - resistant bacteria .",
            "moreover , it may make sense to promote the cooperation among different sectors of the health care system , given that multidrug - resistant bacteria turn up not only in hospitals but also in ambulatory care or in nursing homes . applying",
            "a regional management in a suitable manner also offers the prospect of overcoming the tragedy of the commons problem that besets the current approach to multidrug - resistant bacteria . by implementing the perspective of society in an entire region",
            ", it will be possible to take into account most of the substantial cost effects that are now external . improving surveillance as well as providing reliable information on the appropriate use of antibiotics may help to improve the efficacy of treatment for future patients . in this sense",

            "several substrates of plk4/zyg-1 have been identified to date that include sas-6 , cep152 , and a component of -turc , gcp6 , but it is not clear how phosphorylation of these proteins might affect centriole duplication . to address this question we chose to identify centriole proteins that could be phosphorylated by plk4 in  vitro . to this end",
            "we purified an active form of drosophila plk4 expressed in e.  coli that was able to undertake known autophosphorylation   and was also active toward an artificial substrate ( figure  s1a available online ) .",
            "we first tested whether this preparation of plk4 would phosphorylate proteins found in the outer layers of the centriole   .",
            "this revealed that plk4 could weakly phosphorylate its partner protein , asl ( figure  s1b ) , and cep97 ( figure  s1c ) , a protein that complexes with the cp110 centriole capping protein .",
            "however , it could not phosphorylate the microtubule wall - associated protein , sas4   , ( figure  s1b ) ; rcd4 , a poorly characterized centriole duplication protein ( figure  s1c ) ; or bld10/cep135 , a protein required for maintenance but not formation of the core centriole   ( figure  s1c ) .",
            "we then asked whether the core centriole proteins ana2 and sas6 might be substrates as both are essential for centriole duplication in drosophila   and their respective counterparts in c.  elegans , sas-5 and sas-6 , are immediately downstream of zyg-1 in the recruitment hierarchy of centriole proteins in c.  elegans   . strikingly , plk4 could strongly phosphorylate ana2 but not sas6 ( figures 1a , s1d , and s1e ) , suggesting the possibility that ana2 might be the plk4 substrate that triggers centriole duplication . to test the above hypothesis , we first mapped the sites on ana2 phosphorylated by plk4 in  vitro and tested the significance of their modification .",
            "mass spectrometric analysis revealed multiple plk4 phosphorylation sites of which four serine residues ( s318 , s365 , s370 , and s373 ) ( figures 1b and 1c , arrows , figure  s1 g ) stood out because their total spectral counts ( times a particular phospho - peptide was detected ) were much higher than any others .",
            "moreover , they seemed to be the only plk4 sites in the c - terminal part of ana2 as their mutation to alanine prevented phosphorylation by plk4 in  vitro ( figures 1d and s1f ) .",
            "their functional importance was also suggested by their conservation within the stan motif that characterizes ana2 orthologs ( figure  1c ) and the finding that phosphorylation of the same sites could be detected in  vivo ( see figure  s1 g and legend ) . to test their biological significance , we asked whether ana2 with alanine substitutions at these sites ( ana2 - 4a ) would permit centriole duplication . for this purpose we first established two d.mel-2 cell lines , stably expressing untagged versions of either wild - type ana2 ( ana2-wt ) or ana2 - 4a that each lacked the utrs of the endogenous gene .",
            "three 4-day treatments of control d.mel-2 cells with ds ana2-utr rna led to complete loss of centrioles from 68% of cells ( data not shown ) .",
            "by contrast , depletion of endogenous ana2 from the line expressing the ana2-wt transgene had no significant effect upon centriole number , indicating that it can fully substitute for the endogenous protein .",
            "however , expression of transgenic ana2 - 4a not only failed to rescue endogenous ana2 depletion , but also had a significant dominant - negative effect , an increased proportion of cells lacking centrioles following control - rnai ( figures 1e and 1f ) .",
            "together this demonstrates the functional importance of these four conserved serines in the stan motif of ana2 for centriole duplication .",
            "we next considered whether phosphorylation of ana2 by plk4 might affect its interaction with other components of the centriole duplication machinery . to this end",
            "we loaded recombinant gst - ana2 onto beads , incubated with either active or inactive ( plk4 ) kinase and then with s - methionine - labeled centriole proteins synthesized in  vitro .",
            "we were unable to detect binding of ana2 to either rcd4 or ana1 ; its binding to sas4 showed no change ; and its weaker binding to bld10 showed a 3.5-fold increase in response to ana2 s phosphorylation state ( figures 2a and s2a ) .",
            "however , sas6 showed a dramatic increase in binding to ana2 phosphorylated by plk4 ( figures 2a and 2b ) .",
            "the c - terminal part of ana2 containing the stan motif was necessary and sufficient for this phospho - dependent interaction with sas6 ( figure  2c ) , leading us to test the consequences of mutations at its four plk4 sites .",
            "we found that the ana2 - 4a mutant was unable to interact with sas6 even after incubation with active plk4 ( figure  2b ) , indicating that phosphorylation on these sites is required . when we mutated individual serines to alanines , the strength of the interaction was diminished , particularly with s370a mutant , but not completely abolished ( figure  s2b ) .",
            "thus plk4 phosphorylation of ana2 on all four residues is critical to mediate its interaction with sas6 in  vitro . to validate these findings in  vivo , we cotransfected d.mel-2 cells with sas6-myc and flag - ana2 ( either wt or 4a ) and either active plk4 mutated in its degron ( plk4 ) or inactive plk4 (  nondegradable and kinase - dead",
            "following flag - pulldown we could detect sas6 associated with ana2-wt but not ana2 - 4a and only when coexpressed with the active form of plk4 ( figure  2d ) .",
            "this verifies our in  vitro findings that following phosphorylation by plk4 , ana2 is able to interact with sas6 .",
            "sas6 provides a structural basis for centriole architecture ; its oligomers adopt a 9-fold symmetrical arrangement to form the cartwheel structure of the procentriole   .",
            "stil ( human ana2 ) and hsas6 are the first proteins to follow plk4 to a dot - like structure marking assembly of the procentriole   .",
            "sas6 is essential for correct centriole structure in drosophila although , unlike plk4 , its overexpression does not lead to proper centriole formation in eggs .",
            "however , boosting expression of both sas6 and ana2 stimulates formation of multiple microtubule organizing centers in eggs   and tubular aggregates linked to disengaged centrioles in spermatocytes .",
            "interestingly , however , such sas6 and ana2 could be recruited to centrioles only if plk4 were also overexpressed in spermatocytes leading to centriole overduplication .",
            "these earlier findings might be accounted for if the phosphorylation of ana2 by plk4 triggered the first step in cartwheel formation by sas6 , leading to procentriole formation . to address the above hypothesis",
            ", we first needed to examine the progressive recruitment of ana2 and sas6 to centrioles in their duplication cycle relative to the outer centriolar marker d - plp . at mitotic entry ,",
            "each centrosome comprises a pair of orthogonally engaged centrioles , which we refer to as mother and daughter , surrounded by peri - centriolar , microtubule - nucleating material .",
            "the daughter centriole is immature at this stage and matures during mitosis . in drosophila cells ,",
            "the mother centriole is encircled by a d - plp ring and during maturation , two ",
            "horns  of d - plp progressively extend around the daughter to give a complete ring by metaphase / early anaphase . once the d - plp ring is complete , the paired centrioles disengage during late anaphase so that each newly born cell exits cytokinesis into g1 with two well - separated centrioles ( figure  s3 ) . at mitotic entry ,",
            "sas6 and ana2 are both present in two discrete puncta , one in the center of the mother centriole , the other marking the daughter and yet to become encircled by d - plp .",
            "when the mother and mature daughter disengage , they each have a single dot of ana2 or sas6 at their center .",
            "then , in late anaphase / telophase , a second ana2/sas6 dot appears at the periphery of each physically separated centrioles , marking the site of procentriole formation ( figure  s3 ) . with this knowledge",
            ", we could then address the interdependencies of ana2 and sas6 for their loading onto centrioles .",
            "we found that both ana2-wt and the ana2 - 4a mutant localized to centrioles , arguing that ana2 recruitment does not require its plk4-dependent association with sas6 ( figure  3a ) .",
            "we then explored the ability of endogenous ana2 to localize to centrioles in the absence of sas6 and found this to be largely unaltered ( figure  3b ) .",
            "we then explored the reciprocal possibility by depleting ana2 and assessing the localization of sas6 .",
            "we found that this diminished the level of sas6 by 2- to 3-fold and resulted in centrioles that had only a single central punctum of sas6 .",
            "sas6 failed to load onto anaphase / telophase centrioles in ana2-depleted cells so that the majority of interphase centrioles retained only a single sas6 punctum ( figures 3c and 3d ) .",
            "thus sas6 loading and the consequential formation of the procentriole are dependent on ana2 . because phosphorylation of ana2 by plk4 is required for ana2 to bind sas6 , we determined the effects of plk4 depletion and found that this had similar consequences to ana2 rnai for sas6 loading ( figures 3c and 3e ) .",
            "this accords with a requirement for ana2 to be phosphorylated by plk4 in order to interact with and therefore load sas6 onto the centriole .",
            "finally , to determine whether phosphorylation of the four plk4 sites within the stan motif was critical for sas6 recruitment , we asked whether ana2 - 4a would block the recruitment of sas6 . for this purpose",
            "we depleted the endogenous ana2 from our cell lines overexpressing either ana2-wt or ana2 - 4a and simultaneously monitored the localization of the transgenic ana2 proteins and endogenous sas6 . the great majority ( 91% ,",
            "n  = 34 ) of interphase centrioles in cells with endogenous ana2 substituted by ana2-wt had two colocalizing puncta of ana2 and sas6 on both mother and daughter / procentriole ( figure  4 ) as expected from our above study of untreated cells ( figure  s3 ) . in striking contrast , when endogenous ana2 was substituted with ana2 - 4a , the majority ( 85% , n  = 20 ) of interphase centrioles",
            "had puncta of ana2 on mother and daughter , but sas6 was associated only with the mother ( figure  4 ) .",
            "this further demonstrates that ana2 is able to load onto the site of procentriole formation irrespective of whether it can be phosphorylated by plk4 .",
            "however , plk4-mediated phosphorylation of ana2 is necessary in order to recruit sas6 for procentriole formation .",
            "together our findings suggest a series of events that include disengagement of centrioles at the end of mitosis and the initiation of procentriole formation accompanied by re - engagement by loading sas6 .",
            "this would accord with the finding that centrioles of sas6 mutant spermatocytes in drosophila lose both their 9-fold symmetry and their engagement ; the former being consistent with sas6 s role in establishing the cartwheel structure , the latter suggesting that sas6 is also required to maintain the orthogonal link between mother and daughter .",
            "here we observe that disengagement of the mother / daughter pair occurs immediately following the maturation of the daughter centriole , a process that we see through completion of a ring of d - plp that encircles the daughter s ana2 and sas6 .",
            "this has similarities to the plk1-dependent maturation and disengagement of the mother / daughter centriole pair of human cells as they pass through mitosis   .",
            "effectively , these processes constitute duplication licensing ; they activate a site on the daughter centriole and clear sas6 from the perimeter of the mother , allowing both mother and daughter to initiate procentriole formation . in accord with this notion , we see the recruitment of new ana2 and sas6 onto the mother and daughter only once they have disengaged .",
            "it is of interest to compare our findings on sas6 recruitment in drosophila to events in human cells where sas6 is destroyed during g1 .",
            "a recent study has shown that sas6 is first transiently recruited to the lumen of the mother centriole in s phase before being repositioned to the site of procentriole formation , events that are dependent upon stil ( human ana2 ) and plk4 .",
            "this contrasts to drosophila where sas6 is stable at the core of the centriole once it is incorporated , and only its initial incorporation into procentrioles appears to be dependent on ana2 and plk4 .",
            "our evidence strongly suggests that the very first act of procentriole formation requires ana2 to be phosphorylated by plk4 .",
            "a mutant form of ana2 unable to be phosphorylated at the plk4 sites permits neither sas6 recruitment nor centriole duplication , and depletion of either plk4 or ana2 similarly prevents the spatio - temporal events of sas6 loading .",
            "thus , although we can not exclude the possibility that other protein kinases can also phosphorylate ana2 in  vivo , it seems most probable that ana2 s phosphorylation by plk4 initiates centriole duplication because plk4 is the only known protein kinase whose activity is sufficient for de novo centriole formation .",
            "the phosphorylation of ana2 in its stan motif enables it to recruit sas6 , presumably to form a new cartwheel structure and establish engagement of the new procentrioles to both old mother and daughter .",
            "how does ana2 itself become recruited onto the site of procentriole formation and how is new ana2 ( and hence sas6 ) restricted to this single site ? what is the architecture of the ana2-sas6 complex ?",
            "as we progress further in understanding how the centriole components are pieced together and how these events are controlled by reversible phosphorylation and regulated protein stability , the answers to these questions will surely emerge ."

            "the present study 's results support that physical factors are still valid , as the use of axillary lymph node dissection   was significantly associated with an increased interlimb volume difference , and that social factors should have greater consideration .",
            "the present analysis is among the first to suggest an influential role for low educational attainment as an important risk factor for increased bcrl severity , and in this case , educational attainment had a stronger association than years since treatment and adherence to bcrl care .",

            "this may suggest that the factors related to onset may be different than those associated with severity and progression .",
            "a separate study in hong kong on interlimb arm volume differences   did include a range of social factors related to socioeconomic position , including education and type of job .",
            "while that study similarly found no associations between work status and bcrl severity , it also did not find that education played a role .",
            "this difference in findings might be ascribed to variations in the economic and social returns of educational attainment   in hong kong compared with the us . in this paper 's findings , the lack of significant difference in interlimb volume when comparing college graduates to only high school degrees may further highlight the variability in economic and social returns at each level of education . in the united states ,",
            "educational attainment is considered to be a proxy measure for the larger construct of socioeconomic position , with low attainment being highly correlated with low income , high poverty risk , and reduced access to healthcare resources .",
            "potential mediators of bcrl progression among less educated participants remain speculative but candidates include ( 1 ) higher levels of hand use due to manual labor job , ( 2 ) inflammatory response induced by socioeconomic stressors , ( 3 ) greater use of axillary lymph node dissection for low socioeconomic position patients , and ( 4 ) low access to resources for bcrl management . however , the first three mechanisms were not supported by our data or previous study data . hand use has had mixed results   and work status did not support differences in interlimb differences .",
            "while there were no direct measures of socioeconomic stressors via income or poverty , related household composition measures of number in household and dependent children were not associated with interlimb difference .",
            "receipt of axillary lymph node dissection was also not significantly different by education level . given our data , the most plausible explanation is that lower educational attainment may be linked to greater interlimb differences through worse access to health resources to manage bcrl .",
            "low - resource women may not have what they need to navigate worsening bcrl , especially in light of other competing demands that they face in day - to - day life .",
            "still , in line with other studies with similar populations , adherence to bcrl care did not eliminate the interlimb volume disparity   .",
            "this may suggest that adherence to or usage of bcrl care may not be sufficient to overcome disparities in severity .",
            "in other words , underlying social determinants must be addressed in order to reduce disparities in bcrl severity .",
            "poor access to healthcare resources may mean that low - education women are more likely to deal with healthcare providers who are uninformed about bcrl .",
            "thus , they may not receive proper health education to prevent arm swelling from becoming more severe .",
            "proposed educational interventions have been focused on educating patients about bcrl specifically   but have not modeled patient overall educational attainment   .",
            "the present results suggest that focusing on adherence to bcrl care   and education about bcrl may not be enough to mitigate the risk of greater severity . while there is no evidence that increasing educational attainment itself can reduce the likelihood of bcrl progression or severity , interventions designed to reduce bcrl arm swelling should specially focus on meeting the needs of low - education patients .",
            "contrary to some studies that have shown that bcrl can dissipate on its own in the first 1824 months after treatment   , our analysis aligns with studies suggesting that bcrl may get progressively more severe over time   .",
            "this may support the notion that bcrl is a slowly progressing chronic illness that may worsen with time without active treatment .",
            "adherence to bcrl treatment was associated with higher interlimb volume differences , which may be because women with the most severe bcrl are most likely to be prescribed a treatment regimen and be more likely to adhere to it . given the potential of increased interlimb volume over time , behavioral interventions could be employed to address progression of arm swelling .",
            "behavioral interventions to reduce arm swelling have focused on the use of physical activity and weight loss to stabilize or lower bcrl severity   .",
            "black breast cancer survivors   , who are at risk for higher levels of obesity   and are unlikely to meet recommended physical activity guidelines   but who still need to effectively manage bcrl , may benefit from these interventions .",
            "black women in the general population tend to lose less weight than women from other races during behavioral interventions , and culturally tailoring interventions improves outcomes only modestly   .",
            "unfortunately , thus far , studies on culturally tailored interventions have lacked large sample sizes , long - term follow - up , attention controls , theory - driven behavioral change strategies , or objective measures of physical activity . nor have these prior studies addressed resource disparities .",
            "these interventions may continue to struggle to be successful if they continue to be only tailored culturally and do not account for resource differences among study participants . since less educated black women are more prone to have distinct barriers to physical activity , there needs to be a reevaluation of how to best tailor physical activity and weight loss interventions focused on reducing arm volume due to bcrl . to effectively address bcrl disparities from onset through progression ,",
            "interventions addressing bcrl onset could be tailored by race , given previous findings about race differences in onset , while interventions addressing arm volume changes after onset could be tailored by resource level , given findings from the present analysis .",
            "tailoring interventions by resource is a novel approach that may be supported by the results of the present analysis .",
            "while this study boasts a large community - based sample with broad coverage across a metropolitan area , results may not be generalizable , due to the use of a sample of participants who were healthy enough to enroll in a clinical trial .",
            "the study sample may be healthier or better - resourced than the overall population of cancer survivors .",
            "nearly half of the study sample had a college education , compared to 29.2% of women over 35 in the us ( us census 2014 estimates ) , meaning that these women may be more resourced than their peers and that work and household indicators may not represent stressors for the relatively high - resource women who comprised the study population . since it is not a population - based sample , determining whether or not differences in bcrl severity exist by race or other social factors in the general population is not possible ; however , no existing population - based datasets of the general population include information on bcrl severity , making this study the best available sample to assess these relationships .",

            "secondly , the patient 's diagnostic work - up was coordinated by gastroenterologists , which led to two further cognitive errors being applied : the  availability heuristic , whereby clinicians regular experience with intra - luminal aetiologies such as inflammatory bowel disease , rather than vascular aetiologies , biased the initial investigations , and ",
            "ascertainment bias , whereby clinicians investigated for conditions ( such as inflammatory bowel disease ) that they hoped to find due to their familiarity with subsequent treatment .",
            "thirdly , clinicians were falsely reassured by unremarkable previous abdominal imaging including 2 ct scans and ultrasound .",
            "also falsely reassuring was the absence of biochemical markers of malnutrition such as anaemia or hypoalbuminaemia ; as well as frank lactataemia .",
            "however , serum lactate levels are rarely raised in chronic mesenteric ischaemia due to the capacity of the liver to metabolise lactate delivered via the portal vein . as such , serum lactate is elevated only in cases of critical transmural ischaemia .",
            "fourthly , the patient 's improvement during the hospital stay in the setting of psychosocial stressors engendered a diagnosis of a functional gut disorder and the dual cognitive errors of  fundamental attribution error , whereby clinicians frustrated by an exhaustive course of investigation attributed symptoms to the patient 's personal characteristics , as well as ",
            "we retrospectively theorise that his symptoms improved in the hospital due to smoking cessation , leading to a lower blood carboxyhaemoglobin to oxyhaemoglobin ratio and thereby improving tissue perfusion .",

            "though in - stent restenosis may be a future problem in up to 60% of cases over 2 years , several single - centre series describe favourable outcomes when symptomatic restenosis is treated with further endovascular interventions .",

            "the remaining 4 underwent successful subsequent surgical revascularisation , 3 of whom remained completely revascularised and asymptomatic at 3 years after initial intervention ( 1 died of an unrelated cause ) .",
            "even if surgical intervention were needed for restenosis , this is theoretically associated with a lower risk of peri - procedural complications compared to first - line surgical therapy as the patient will have undergone an intervening period of nourishment and reconditioning .",
            "the choice to combine balloon angioplasty and stenting for our patient is supported by a systemic review of 328 patients undergoing endovascular intervention in 16 studies   suggesting that , while not reaching statistical significance , this approach trends toward higher initial technical success compared to angioplasty alone ( 92 vs 83% , p = 0.09 ) but decreased restenosis rates compared to stenting alone ( 26 vs. 35% , p = 0.10 ) .",
            "this case highlights the importance of recognising atypical presentations of gastrointestinal conditions as well as considering causes for diarrhoea outside the gut lumen .",
            "importantly , it serves as an illustration of multiple cognitive errors to which clinicians may be susceptible in practice .",

            "therefore , the cellular concentration of neutrophils in the inflammatory infiltrates decreases during the transition between gingivitis and periodontitis , in which there is a predominance of lymphocytes .",
            "it has been described that proinflammatory cytokines , prostaglandin e2 , matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) , nitric oxide ( no ) , and other inflammatory mediators play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pd   . moreover ,",

            "there is strong evidence that estrogen deficiency influences the severity of periodontitis , since worse periodontal parameters were observed as bleeding on probing , gingival recession , and clinical attachment loss in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis .",
            "cigarette smoking is considered an important risk factor for the development of rheumatoid arthritis , since it was demonstrated that lifelong cigarette smoking was positively associated with the risk of ra even among smokers with a low lifelong exposure .",

            "the conventional synthetic dmards include methotrexate , sulfasalazine , and leflunomide ; the available tumor necrosis factor inhibitors ( adalimumab , etanercept , and infliximab ) , the t cell costimulation inhibitor ( abatacept ) , the anti - b cell agent ( rituximab ) , and the interleukin-6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibody are included in biological dmards .",
            "these medications may be associated with glucocorticoids ( gc ) or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) . the long - term",
            ", low - dose glucocorticoid and nsaids therapy were shown to reduce joint symptoms , pain , and other systemic manifestations   .",
            "although these benefits are present , the long - time treatment with gc and methotrexate decreased immune response and promoted oral changes , such as candidiasis , periodontitis , and oral ulceration besides impaired saliva secretion .",
            "indeed the literature demonstrated that patients on corticosteroids exhibited higher levels of candidiasis , clinical attachment loss , and probing pocket depth .",
            "these aspects , at least in part , may contribute to the worse periodontal status of ra patients when compared to healthy patients .",
            "moreover , the use of medications referred to in half of the articles could compromise the evaluation of this review .",
            "however , it is noteworthy that the other half of the articles did not use any medication   . analysing the articles ,",
            "it was observed that most patients with ra showed a significant increase in the incidence of pd as compared to healthy individuals , while only few articles concluded the opposite , probably due to the lack of standardization of parameters in evaluating the different types of periodontitis . although epidemiological studies outlined by dev et al .",
            "( 2013 )   have not observed a significant ra incidence in subjects with periodontitis where these authors suggested that periodontitis is an independent factor for ra , several other studies have shown that patients with ra were more susceptible to the development of periodontitis   , since these patients had worse periodontal parameters , such as clinical attachment level   , alveolar bone loss   , probing depth   , plaque index , and bleeding on probing   . indeed , the mechanical periodontal treatment as scaling and root planning in the control of periodontal infection interfered not only with the severity of ra but also with the periodontal clinical parameters .",
            "this result can be explained by a reduction in the foci of oral bacteria , and therefore the low levels of inflammation demonstrated a decrease of das28 ( disease activity score in 28 joints ) and serum levels of il-1 , tnf- , c - reactive protein , and erythrocyte rate sedimentation   . in this sense , studies have defended the hypothesis that oral infections play an important role in the pathogenesis of ra , promoting the citrullination of proteins , which can be based on the detection of bacterial dna using the techniques of dna isolation ( pcr and dna - dna hybridization ) and high titers of antibodies against bacteria in synovial fluid and serum samples from patients with ra   .",

            "moreover , it has been reported that these microparticles play an important role in thrombosis and angiogenesis and mediate cellular communication by transferring mrnas and micrornas from the cell of origin to target cells .",
            "thus , the microparticle participation and its spread into the bloodstream could constitute the explanation to the increased risk for systemic disease in patients with periodontitis . despite these evidences showing a link between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis , the exact mechanisms involving this association",
            "thus , well - designed longitudinal multicentre clinical trials and further studies with sufficient sample sizes are required to determine the biochemical processes and clinical relationships between these chronic inflammatory conditions .",

            "ligation of cd47 induces the translocation of bnip3 to mitochondria , and attenuation of bnip3 activity inhibits cd47-induced apoptosis , which together suggests that bnip3 is crucial as a mediator of this cell death pathway .",
            "moreover , bnip3 gene expression was found to be increased and regulated by hypoxia - inducible factor-1 ( hif-1 ) following the ligation of cd47 by single - chain fragments of an anti - cd47 mab which kills b - cll cell lines both in vitro and in vivo , where the knockdown of hif-1 represses cd47-induced cell death   ( figure 2 ) .",
            "the finding that a jurkat t cell clone lacking cd47 is resistant to fas- ( cd95- ) induced apoptosis , but that expression of cd47 restores the sensitivity to fas - ligation , suggested that cd47 can augment fas - induced apoptosis via a mechanism that requires neither cd47 signaling nor its association with lipid rafts .",
            "in fact , the lack of cd47 impairs important proapoptotic events downstream of fas , such as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential , cytochrome c release , caspase activation , poly(adp - ribose ) polymerase ( parp ) cleavage , and dna fragmentation .",
            "this function of cd47 is likely also important in primary cells , since t cells from cd47-deficient mice are protected from fas - induced apoptosis . in hematopoietic cells ,",
            "cd47-induced apoptosis has been described in hematopoietic tumor cells   and in activated primary t or b cells   . however , whether apoptosis can be induced through cd47 in nonactivated leukocytes is still somewhat unclear .",
            "the only situation where nonactivated t or b cells have been found to undergo cd47-induced apoptosis is when immobilized anti - cd47 mab has been used , but not when using soluble cd47 ligands or mabs known to induce apoptosis in activated cells or tumor cells   .",
            "surprisingly , although cd34 hematopoietic progenitors express cd47 , they are resistant to cd47-induced apoptosis by either immobilized or soluble mab   . in addition , immature human monocyte - derived dendritic cells ( idcs ) were described as resistant to cd47-induced apoptosis , following incubation with an immobilized cd47 mab for 18 hours .",

            "thus , these findings suggest that although a subset of idc may undergo cd47-induced cell death at an early time point , this may not be detectable at later time points",
            ". however , it raises the question if specific subsets of monocytes or idcs are sensitive to this form of rapid cell death whereas others are resistant and maintain their viability in culture .",
            "in addition to hematopoietic cells , overexpression of cd47 can induces cell death of cultured cerebral cortical neurons , which is enhanced by the coexpression of sirp and prevented by brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) when cd47 and sirp are coexpressed .",
            "apoptosis in neurons overexpressing cd47 , however , is dependent on caspases and apoptotic cells have condensed apoptotic nuclei with fragmented dna .",
            "it has also been shown that endothelial cells incubated under static conditions in the absence of flow increase their expression of tsp-1 , which uses the cd47/ \n v \n  \n 3 integrin as a receptor to trigger endothelial cell apoptosis .",

            "in contrast to the proapoptotic effects of cd47 described above , it was reported that the tsp-1-derived peptide 4n1 could abolish c2-ceramide - induced apoptosis in primary porcine thyroid cells by preventing reduction in intracellular camp levels , an effect blocked by the functional blocking antihuman cd47 mab b6h12 . a similar effect of 4n1 peptide",

            "although it is unclear how these effects of cd47-ligation can be explained in relation to the proapoptotic effects of this molecule , it is interesting to note that tumor cell tsp-1 overexpression has been linked to disease recurrence and decreased survival   , and it was suggested that this pathway could be one explanation behind drug resistance in thyroid cancers .",
            "mature erythrocytes express high levels of cd47 , but do not express integrins , which early indicated that other important functions of cd47 could be expected in these cells . the fact that individuals with the rhnull phenotype , which do not express any of the proteins of the rh protein complex , only express about 25% of normal levels of cd47 suggested a close relation between cd47 and erythrocyte rh proteins   . in the erythrocyte cell membrane , rh polypeptides associate in a complex with many other proteins ( e.g. , rh associated glycoprotein ( rhag ) , glycophorin b , lw , and cd47 ) .",
            "another erythrocyte membrane protein complex is formed by the band 3 anion exchanger and several other proteins ( e.g. , glycophorin a , protein 4.2 , and ankyrin ) .",

            "mutations in band 3 , or complete band 3 deficiency , in human erythrocytes results in reduced expression of rh polypeptides and rhag   and results in a virtual lack of cd47 .",
            "moreover , human erythrocytes deficient in protein 4.2 also show a marked deficiency of cd47 as well as an altered glycosylation of rhag . when combining these finding , a hypothesis was put forward , which suggests that cd47 of the rh complex may indeed form a link to the band 3 complex by binding to protein 4.2   ( figure 3 ) .",
            "studies of protein mobility within the erythrocyte membrane have shown that cd47 is associated with the erythrocyte cytoskeleton as being a part of the rh complex , but that cd47 is also present as a noncytoskeleton anchored pool which is more mobile in the erythrocyte membrane .",
            "thus , cd47 in erythrocytes may serve several different functions depending on its grade of mobility in the plasma membrane .",
            "it has been suggested that the freely mobile cd47 pool may be of importance to accumulate cd47 in specific membrane areas upon cell - cell contacts , for example , in order to efficiently interact with sirp on other cell types such as phagocytic cells .",
            "importantly , data from studies of murine erythrocytes have shown remarkable differences as compared with human erythrocytes , and the link between cd47 , the rh complex , and protein 4.2 in murine erythrocytes is not well understood . first , there are little or no rh polypeptides in erythrocytes from band 3-deficient mice , while the expression of cd47 is only slightly reduced .",
            "second , erythrocytes from cd47-deficient mice were found to contain normal amounts of murine rh and rhag polypeptides .",
            "taken together , the total picture suggests that cd47 seems to interact with rh polypeptides and protein 4.2 in human erythrocytes , whereas the interaction between cd47 , rh polypeptides , and proteins of the band 3 complex in murine erythrocytes is still unclear .",
            "a progressive decrease in the cd47 expression level has been observed on human erythrocytes stored under blood bank conditions at + 4c for more than 14 days   and in a mouse model of erythrocyte storage which tried to mimic human blood bank conditions .",
            "however , the magnitude of reduction in cd47 expression was rather different , from a modest reduction of up to 6% at day 42 of storage , around 30% reduction on day 28 of storage , to a more than 50% reduction on day 14 of storage .",
            "furthermore , a recent study indicated that the cd47 levels of erythrocytes stored for 35 days were not different from that of fresh cells .",
            "the discrepancy between these findings may have several explanations , such as the exact storage conditions or methods for the quantification of erythrocyte cd47 expression levels .",
            "in addition , the loss of cd47 may also be sensitive to leukocytes remaining in the erythrocyte concentrates .",
            "indeed , a gradual loss of cd47 from erythrocytes during storage was observed in stored erythrocytes irrespective of whether the buffy coat was removed or not before storage , although buffy coat removal resulted in an increased expression level of cd47 at all time points tested , showing a significant correlation between the number of remaining leukocytes and erythrocyte cd47 levels .",
            "a study of cryopreserved leukoreduced erythrocytes was unable to detect any effects on erythrocyte cd47 expression levels .",
            "microparticles released in the blood from blood cells or endothelial cells have recently gained interest due to their possible role in regulating a variety of normal or pathological biological functions .",
            "such microparticles are also released from erythrocytes during cryopreservation or storage at + 4c , and these microparticles do among other erythrocyte membrane proteins also carry cd47   . although the presence of cd47 on these microparticles suggests a mechanism for the observed loss of cd47 from stored erythrocytes , soluble cd47 has also been detected in the supernatants of erythrocytes stored at + 4c .",
            "in addition to a possible loss of cd47 on stored erythrocytes , a recent study also indicated that storage as well as experimental aging in vitro results in a conformational change of the cd47 protein .",
            "this modification can be detected as a selectively increased binding of the anti - cd47 mab 2d3 , which recognizes an epitope different from the epitope involved in the binding of tsp-1 or sirp and recognized by mab b6h12 .",
            "however , the use of mouse models has been informative to further understand if the level of cd47 is changing during erythrocyte aging . in these models",

            "sickle cell disease , caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin  chain and a formation of insoluble intracellular aggregates of mutated hemoglobin , resulting in characteristic sickle shaped erythrocytes , is associated with severe vasoocclusive crisis   .",
            "one important mechanism behind this pathology is the enhanced adhesion of sickle erythrocytes to vascular endothelium   .",
            "cd47 was shown to play a role in the pathologic sequestration of sickle erythrocytes to vascular endothelium under shear stress by binding to tsp .",
            "it has been found that the reticulocyte - enriched fractions of sickle erythrocytes are most efficiently binding to endothelial cells , that this function requires heterotrimeric g proteins and tyrosine kinase activity , and is mediated by  \n 4 \n  \n 1 integrins on the reticulocytes .",
            "interestingly , sickle erythrocytes also show an increased expression of the cd47 epitope recognized by mab 2d3 . in gaucher 's disease , a sphingolipidosis caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency , macrophages accumulate glucosylceramide following the excess phagocytosis of erythrocytes , which converts splenic macrophages to pathogenic gaucher cells",

            "it has been suggested that the anemia associated with the untreated disease can in part be explained by a combination of reduced cd47 levels together with other morphological erythrocyte abnormalities observed in this disease .",
            "the distinction between self and non - self is central to the maintenance of integrity in a multicellular organism and allows for a powerful and successful elimination of potentially dangerous pathogens , while carefully preserving healthy host cells and tissues .",
            "this distinction has been well studied in the adaptive immune response , which is specialized in the recognition of foreign peptides by virtue of small modifications to major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) molecules made by these peptides . for the innate immune system",
            ", recognition is thought to be based on a large extent on the recognition of specific microbial structures , pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) .",
            "the innate immune system of the host organism has through the evolution developed a group of receptors , pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) , which serves to specifically recognize pamps . in this way ,",
            "the host may utilize a certain number of receptors , encoded in the genome , for the recognition of various evolutionary stable molecular pathogen - associated structures .",
            "while some of the prrs ( like the mannose receptor ( mr ) ) recognize pamps directly , others ( like complement receptors ( crs ) ) are specialized to detect products generated secondary to pamp recognition . however , a system based on specific recognition of  foreign  is clearly flawed as it prevents the recognition of anything that is also present on the organism 's own cells .",
            "this can be very elegantly circumvented by a defense system that has very broad recognition , when it is combined with specific molecules that mark host cells and tissues as  self .  thus , recognition of  self  will inhibit the activation of innate immune cells , whereas the recognition of  missing self  allows for an immune response to proceed .",
            "in other words , a system where the own cells express a unique marker of self , not present on foreign cells , would make the distinction between self and foreign very simple . in that way",
            ", it would not matter if the organism 's own cells express substances or ligands that are similar to those found on foreign cells / particles .",
            "innate immune cells such as macrophages would only look for the presence of the  self marker  on the recognized particle , where the presence of self would release the recognized particle but the absence of self would allow for activation and destruction .",
            "this would significantly simplify the recognition process , as there would only be a need for a few broad specific recognition receptors instead of a countless number of foreign - specific receptors .",
            "it would also fulfill the criteria for a defense system that effectively recognize and destroy foreign objects but at the same time reduces the risk of damaging the organism 's own structures . such a system for macrophage activation would be analogous to the well - established  missing - self hypothesis  for natural killer ( nk ) cell activation .",
            "nk cells recognize target cells by a range of activating receptors which also recognize ligands on many normal cells .",
            "however , in the nk cell system expression of self - mhc class i will protect the recognized cell via the ligation of nk cell inhibitory receptors specific for ",
            "it is , however , important to note , that nk cell inhibitory receptors are now described , which seem to have ligands other than mhc class i . upon the binding of self - mhc class i , ligated nk cell inhibitory receptors will recruit and activate the phosphatases shp-1/shp-2 that mediate the inhibition of nk cell activation .",
            "nk cells thus spare cells whenever they express  markers of normal self ,  and eliminate them when these markers are absent or inadequately expressed .",
            "other leukocytes also express molecules related to nk cell inhibitory receptors , further suggesting that similar mechanisms are operative also , for example , in macrophage activation .",
            "many of these inhibitory receptors recognize mhc class i , but the  marker of self  could in principle be any ubiquitously expressed surface molecule .",
            "a new chapter in the understanding of cd47 and its functions started when cd47 was found to bind sirp   . at the time",
            ", sirp was regarded as one of several immunoreceptors with cytoplasmic itim motifs , generally suggested to be involved in negative regulation of cellular functions , mediated by the recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatases shp-1 and/or shp-2 or the inositol phosphatase ship to the tyrosine phosphorylated itims . in addition , sirp was found to be highly expressed in primary macrophages and macrophage cell lines , as well as in other myeloid cells such as monocytes , granulocytes , and dendritic cells . in macrophages , sirp was found to negatively regulate signaling through tyrosine kinase - dependent signaling pathways ( e.g. , fcri ) .",
            "although both shp-1 and shp-2 can bind to the phosphorylated sirp itims , only shp-1 has been associated with the inhibitory function of sirp in macrophages , similar to that of the nk cell inhibitory receptors , whereas shp-2 associated with sirp leads to a phosphatase - dependent enhancement of the signal in many situations .",
            "when studying cd47-deficient mice , we were struck by the fact that cd47-deficient bone marrow can not reconstitute and engraft in lethally irradiated syngeneic wild - type recipient mice , while it engrafts normally in cd47-deficient recipient mice .",
            "our work on trying to understand this controversy first involved experiments where different leukocyte populations were transferred from cd47-deficient mice into wild - type recipient mice .",
            "however , we later simplified the system by studying transfusion of erythrocytes instead of leukocytes .",
            "the reason for this is that erythrocytes in contrast to many leukocyte populations have a long half - life in circulation , they do not divide , do not express mhc class i , and they do not home to extravascular tissues or organs .",
            "these studies showed that fresh erythrocytes isolated from the blood of cd47-deficient mice , labeled with a fluorescent cell tracker dye and transfused into wild - type recipient mice , have markedly reduced survival , whereas their half - life is normal in cd47-deficient recipients .",
            "the clearance rate of such freshly isolated cd47-deficient erythrocytes is remarkably fast with complete clearance within 24 hours . to put this in perspective , the average lifespan of murine erythrocytes in circulation is somewhere between 45 and 60 days , depending on the mouse strain investigated   .",
            "the rapid clearance of cd47-deficient erythrocytes from the circulation of wild - type recipient mice does not require complement , since cd47-deficient erythrocytes are also cleared from the circulation of complement factor 3- ( c3- ) deficient mice . neither is there a requirement for lymphocytes or antibodies to enable the clearance of cd47-deficient erythrocytes from the circulation , since clearance is normal in rag1-deficient mice , which lack mature t and b lymphocytes .",
            "rather , the transfused cd47-deficient erythrocytes that are eliminated from the circulation of wild - type mice are recognized and cleared by splenic red pulp macrophages , and the removal of these macrophages by splenectomy or by treatment with macrophage - toxic clodronate liposomes   abrogates the elimination of cd47-deficient erythrocytes .",
            "furthermore , macrophage sirp is tyrosine phosphorylated upon contact with cd47 on erythrocytes , and when sirp on isolated splenic macrophages is blocked , it increases the level of phagocytosis of wild - type erythrocytes to that seen with cd47-deficient erythrocytes , whereas phagocytosis of the cd47-deficient erythrocytes is unaffected by the antibody treatment .",
            "in addition , studies in sirp-mutant mice , where the cytoplasmic signaling domain of the receptor is deleted , have shown a shorter half - life of normal cd47-expressing erythrocytes in these mice , which also present with mild anemia .",
            "such spontaneous anemia is , however , not seen in cd47-deficient mice , suggesting that cd47 could also be needed on the macrophages to facilitate the clearance of erythrocytes in the spleen .",
            "however , lack of cd47 on platelets also results in very rapid clearance when transfused into wild - type recipients , and both cd47-deficient mice and sirp-mutant mice have a mild spontaneous antibody - independent thrombocytopenia   .",
            "altogether , these findings indicated that all erythrocytes can be phagocytosed by splenic red pulp macrophages when sirp is blocked or cd47 is missing , and that these macrophages must have a receptor for erythrocytes . indeed , we have identified ldl receptor - related protein ( lrp-1 ) , which by recognizing calreticulin on the surface of normal erythrocytes can mediate phagocytosis of untreated cd47-deficient erythrocytes   . by showing that macrophages in the splenic red pulp can recognize normal circulating erythrocytes , but that these macrophages do not phagocytose erythrocytes as long as they display cd47 on their surface ,",
            "these findings were the first to prove that macrophages are perfectly capable of recognizing  normal  host cells and rely on  self  recognition for proper function .",
            "in addition , it also demonstrated major similarities between mechanisms for  self  recognition in nk cells and macrophages .",
            "based on the findings that unopsonized erythrocytes lacking cd47 can be phagocytosed by splenic macrophages , and that the cd47/sirp interaction can potently inhibit the prophagocytic mechanism operating in that situation , we next hypothesized that the cd47/sirp interaction might as well be able to negatively regulate phagocytosis of opsonized erythrocytes , and that for the cells of the innate immune systems front line defense ( i.e. , macrophages and dc ) there would be a balance between signals from activating receptors ( e.g. , fcr or cr ) and the inhibitory signal from sirp ligated by target cell cd47 . indeed , the cd47/sirp interaction can also regulate phagocytosis of igg - opsonized or complement opsonized erythrocytes as well as other opsonized host cells , making cd47-deficient cells severely sensitive to being phagocytosed   .",
            "in addition , cd47-deficient mice are severely sensitive to experimental autoimmune hemolytic anemia ( aiha ) and experimental thrombocytopenia   . on an autoimmune background",
            "prone to develop spontaneous aiha , lack of cd47 results in a more rapid and lethal aiha .",
            "using motheathen viable ( me / me ) mice , which only have about 20% of normal levels of shp-1 , but normal levels of shp-2   , we could pinpoint the role of these phosphatases in mediating the phagocytosis inhibitory effect of the cd47/sirp interaction in vivo .",
            "when transfused into me / me mice , igg - opsonized wild - type erythrocytes are cleared with the same rapid kinetics as seen with equally opsonized cd47-deficient erythrocytes , showing that at that particular signaling strength through prophagocytic fc receptors , the level of cd47 on normal erythrocytes was not enough to prevent phagocytosis if the shp-1 level was reduced by about 80% .",
            "in contrast , the prophagocytic signaling mediating phagocytosis of unopsonized cd47-deficient erythrocytes ( presumably mediated by lrp-1 ) is likely much weaker , since unopsonized wild - type erythrocytes are not cleared with the same rapid kinetics as cd47-deficient cells in me / me mice .",
            "however , while unopsonized cd47 heterozygous erythrocytes ( expressing about 50% of the cd47 found on wild - type erythrocytes ) show normal half - life when transfused into wild - type recipients , they were found to be cleared more rapidly when transfused into me / me mice .",
            "these findings thus proposed that a reduction of the cd47 level to 50% of normal , in combination with a strongly reduced level of shp-1 in the macrophages , together weakened the inhibitory signaling through sirp such that clearance of unopsonized erythrocytes was allowed .",
            "furthermore , the rate of phagocytosis of igg - opsonized erythrocytes is distinctly regulated by the amount of cd47 present on the surface of the erythrocytes both in vivo and in vitro . thus , activation of phagocytosis in a macrophage in contact with a target erythrocyte ( or any other host cell ) can be viewed as a balance between signals from activating receptors ( i.e. , fcr , cr , or lrp-1 ) and the inhibitory signal from sirp ligated by target cell cd47 . in the macrophage , neither signal appears to be dominant , but rather the decision to phagocytose a target host cell is based on an integration of positive prophagocytic signals and inhibitory cd47/sirp signaling ( figure 4(a ) ) .",
            "the same functional regulation also seems to be operating in dcs   and in microglia . in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis",
            ", hematopoietic stem cells are phagocytosed by bone marrow macrophages as a result of systemic inflammation . in this disease ,",
            "hematopoietic stem cells were found to express reduced levels of cd47 , which shows that pathological conditions may occur where a combination of inflammatory macrophage activation and reduced expression of cd47 results in a severe loss of critical cell types . however , not all prophagocytic receptors seem to be regulated by the cd47/sirp interaction .",
            "although fc receptor - mediated phagocytosis of igg - opsonized oxidatively damaged erythrocytes is strongly inhibited by the cd47/sirp interaction , scavenger receptor - mediated uptake of unopsonized oxidized erythrocytes turned out to be insensitive to this inhibitory mechanism .",
            "the mechanism whereby recruitment of shp-1 to sirp can inhibit phagocytosis has been suggested to involve the tyrosine kinase syk and phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( pi3 kinase ) .",
            "more recently , it was suggested that shp-1 mediates dephosphorylation of nonmuscular myosin iia at the phagocytic synapse between the phagocyte and a host cell , as a result of the interaction between macrophage sirp and cd47 on the host cell , which brings further insight into the mechanism behind phagocytosis inhibition by the cd47/sirp interaction .",
            "based on the seemingly important interaction between cd47 and sirp to prevent phagocytosis of host cells , and the fact that cd47-deficient cells are rapidly phagocytosed when transfused into wild - type mice , it is clearly a puzzle why cd47-deficient mice do not present with a more severe phenotype where the macrophages phagocytose a large fraction of the cd47-deficient cells in those mice .",
            "however , this phenomenon is rather similar to what is described in 2 microglobulin deficient mice , which lack expression of mhc class i but where the nk cells still do not attack and destroy host cells and also show hyporeactivity to cells carrying ligands for activating nk cell receptors , cells which are efficiently killed by wild - type nk cells .",
            "one explanation proposed for this function in nk cells is that inhibitory nk cell receptors need to interact with",
            "licenced  and able to become activated and kill target cells lacking or expressing reduced levels of ",
            "self-  mhc class i . by investigating the ability to phagocytose cd47-deficient cells in mice where cd47 was expressed by hematopoietic cells , nonhematopoietic cells , or both , the phagocytic  tolerance  to cells lacking cd47 in cd47-deficient mice",
            "it was found that macrophages developing in an environment where nonhematopoietic cells lack cd47 become  tolerant  to cells lacking cd47 , which allowed cd47-defcient leukocytes to avoid clearance .",
            "curiously , this did not involve erythrocytes , which were cleared by splenic macrophages also in the bone marrow chimeras where nonhematopoietic cells lacked cd47 and macrophages had become ",
            "the latter phenomenon has so far not been explained , but may suggest that phagocytosis of erythrocytes is regulated differently from that of leukocytes .",
            "although cd47-deficient macrophages express normal amounts of sirp , which can also become tyrosine phosphorylated upon contact with cd47 expressing cells ( oldenborg et al . , unpublished observations and ) , it is possible that the  tolerance  to cd47-deficient cells that develop in cd47-deficient mice has to do with tuning of intracellular signaling pathways . in favor of such a hypothesis is the observation that transfused igg - opsonized wild - type erythrocytes are cleared from the circulation at a significantly slower rate in cd47-deficient mice , as compared with that seen in wild - type recipient mice ( oldenborg et al .",
            "this is unlikely due to a different expression of fc receptors in cd47-deficient mice , since cd47-deficient igg - opsonized erythrocytes are cleared with the same kinetics in both wild - type and cd47-deficient recipient mice ( oldenborg et al .",
            "apoptosis is a physiological process of programmed cell death which is important for embryologic development , maintenance of homeostasis , and elimination of damaged cells .",
            "an important event related to this process is the rapid uptake of apoptotic cells or apoptotic bodies by phagocytic cells .",
            "the efficacy of this process in the body is shown by the fact that apoptotic cells are apparently removed with such extremely high efficiency that apoptotic cells are very hard to detect in tissues under normal physiological conditions .",
            "it has even been suggested that if apoptotic cells are in fact detected in vivo , this may indicate a possibility of defects in their clearance or the presence of a large overload of apoptotic cells   .",
            "the largest part of apoptotic cell phagocytosis is mediated not only by professional phagocytes like macrophages and dcs , but also to some extent by nonprofessional phagocytes such as fibroblasts ; epithelial cells and stromal cells are equipped with this function .",
            "one example of the latter phenomenon is the phagocytosis of apoptotic mammary epithelial cells by bystander epithelial cells during mammary gland involution   .",
            "when cd47 was identified as a cell surface protein on host cells that can negatively regulate their phagocytosis through sirp , one important question was to understand if this signaling pathway is altered during apoptosis to facilitate uptake of apoptotic cells .",
            "one hypothesis would be that apoptotic cells downregulate the amount of cd47 on their surface , which together with an increased amount of prophagocytic ligands exposed during apoptosis would result in phagocytosis of the dead cells .",
            "indeed we found a reduced expression of cd47 on apoptotic fibroblasts and neutrophils , but curiously not on apoptotic jurkat t cells   or apoptotic murine thymocytes .",
            "this issue became even more confusing when apoptotic murine t cells lacking cd47 , in contrast to the solid data showing that cd47 on host cells inhibits phagocytosis by macrophages , were found to be phagocytosed less efficiently by macrophages than equally apoptotic cd47 wild - type t cells   .",
            "in apoptotic murine t cells , cd47 was rather found to be important in mediating tethering of the apoptotic cells to the phagocyte   .",
            "in addition , cd47 is redistributed into patches on the apoptotic cell surface , areas of the plasma membrane which are different than those harbouring clusters of proteins that function as ligands for prophagocytic receptors   .",
            "thus , one possibility would be that the segregation of cd47 away from these phagocytosis promoting ligands could allow for tethering mediated by the cd47/sirp interaction , but that sirp would be too far away from the prophagocytic receptors to be involved in negative regulation ( figure 4(b ) ) .",
            "another very interesting hypothesis was recently suggested , which shed new light on this process .",
            "as described above in section 4.2 experimentally oxidized erythrocytes , as well as erythrocytes stored in blood bank conditions , showed enhanced expression of the cd47 epitope recognized by mab 2d3 , suggesting a conformational change in the cd47 igv domain .",
            "importantly , this is associated with an increased binding of tsp-1 to cd47 , which together could generate a new binding site for sirp that induces a prophagocytic signal instead of the  normal  inhibitory cd47/sirp signal .",
            "however , this very interesting hypothesis still has to also be investigated in the context of macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic nucleated cells such as neutrophils or t cells .",
            "thus , cd47 may operate in several different ways during cellular senescence in order to switch its normal phagocytosis - preventing role to rather facilitate and promote the phagocytosis of senescent cells .",
            "lrp-1 is a multifunctional scavenger receptor , shown to be involved in mediating uptake of apoptotic cells   , and as already mentioned it can also bind to calreticulin on viable erythrocytes to induce phagocytosis if the inhibitory cd47/sirp interaction is not strong enough   ( figure 4(b ) ) .",
            "glucocorticoids are powerful in treatment of inflammatory conditions , which can be attributed to their ability to downregulate production of and cellular responses to proinflammatory cytokines and their ability to inhibit the recruitment of inflammatory cells   .",
            "however , another mechanism whereby glucocorticoids may also reduce inflammation is to stimulate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells   . interestingly ,",
            "glucocorticoid treatment of macrophages results in increased macrophage expression of lrp-1 and increased phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or viable cd47-deficient erythrocytes .",
            "since cd47 can inhibit phagocytosis of host cells , and the amount of cd47 on the cell surface is clearly important in determining the phagocytosis efficiency of macrophages , this also raised the question on whether cells such as tumor cells can also increase their cd47 expression levels in order to escape macrophage elimination .",
            "indeed , early studies showed that ovarian carcinoma cell lines express increased levels of cd47   , the functional significance of which was unclear at that time .",
            "more recently , an enhanced expression of cd47 has been reported for murine myeloid leukemias , as well as human normal and leukemic hematopoietic stem cells and many human solid tumors   , and that increased cd47 expression is associated with reduced patient survival in aml and solid tumors   . to challenge the hypothesis that cd47 on the leukemic cells protects from phagocytosis by macrophages and supports tumor cell growth ,",
            "a xenogenic mouse model was used to study a particular human aml clone ( molm-13 ) with very low endogenous cd47 expression .",
            "expression of murine cd47 in molm-13 cells and transplantation of molm-13 clones expressing low or high levels of cd47 showed an enrichment and spreading of the cd47-high expressing clones to many bones of recipient mice , while the cd47-low clones showed minimal engraftment .",
            "depletion of macrophages in recipient mice allows for engraftment of cd47-low clones , and macrophage phagocytosis of aml cells both in vitro and in vivo is selective for tumor cells expressing low amounts of cd47 .",
            "importantly , by blocking sirp on macrophages , phagocytosis of cd47-high aml cells is increased to that seen with cd47-low clones .",
            "thus , these findings strongly suggest that an increased cd47 expression level on tumor cells could serve to avoid macrophage clearance and promote dissemination of tumor cells ( figure 4(c ) ) .",
            "it was also recently shown that treatment serving to block the cd47/sirp interaction can result in elimination of aml stem cells in a xenogenic model .",
            "furthermore , inline with our original finding that the cd47/sirp pathway also potently inhibits fc receptor - mediated phagocytosis of igg - opsonized host cells   , it has been shown that antibody - mediated blocking of cd47/sirp signaling promotes phagocytosis of non - hodgkin lymphoma cells treated with rituximab   and antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( adcc ) against her2/neu - positive breast cancer cells treated with traztusumab .",
            "thus , blocking the cd47/sirp interaction may prove to be a powerful tool in the treatment of various tumors .",
            "while organ transplantation is an important procedure to treat end - stage organ failure , it is hampered by a shortage of organ donors . to solve this problem ,",
            "it has been suggested that pigs could serve as donors of organs , tissues , or cells to be transplanted into humans ( i.e. , xenotransplantation )   .",
            "both the innate and adaptive immune system participates in the rejection of xenogenic transplants , the exact details of which is outside the scope of the present paper .",
            "however , of particular interest here are the findings suggesting that even in the absence of a functional adaptive immune system and in the absence of nk cells ( both of which react to cell surface determinants of xenogenic cells recognized as non - self ) , rejection of xenogenic cells and tissues is seen , which suggests that macrophages could play an important role in this process . indeed , in studies of transplantation of pancreatic islets   or hematopoietic cells   from pigs to mice , macrophage depletion significantly enhances engraftment . the ability of macrophage sirp to inhibit phagocytosis by binding to cd47 on a target cell , and the fact that this interaction is rather species specific suggested that this interaction could play a role in macrophage - mediated clearance of xenogenic cells .",
            "indeed , it was found that porcine cd47 can not bind to murine sirp and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the sirp itims , which could explain the rapid clearance of porcine hematopoietic cells by macrophages both in vitro and in vivo   .",
            "however , expression of murine cd47 in porcine cells markedly inhibits macrophage - mediated phagocytosis of these cells in vitro and prolongs their survival in vivo .",
            "although a human sirp fusion protein was found to bind to porcine cd47 , porcine cd47 does not activate human sirp . as a result",
            ", porcine hematopoietic cells are rapidly phagocytosed by human macrophages , but expression of human cd47 in porcine cells results in attenuated phagocytosis by human macrophages .",
            "these findings indicate that transgenic pigs expressing human cd47 could be an important possibility to further help reducing the rejection of porcine cells in xenotransplantation .",
            "the finding that cd47 , by binding to sirp , could regulate rat alveolar macrophage fusion and formation of multinucleated giant cells in vitro   suggested a function also in regulating formation of bone - resorbing osteoclasts and regulation of bone homeostasis . using functional blocking monoclonal antibodies against either cd47 or sirp , the formation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase ( trap ) multinucleated osteoclasts is strongly inhibited in murine cell culture systems in vitro .",
            "this finding can also be confirmed in vivo , since cd47-deficient mice have reduced numbers of osteoclasts in bone   and are protected from tumor metastasis and subsequent bone resorption .",
            "there are a few hypotheses presented to explain the mechanism whereby the interaction between cd47 and sirp promotes osteoclastogenesis .",
            "one suggests that binding of cd47 results in sirp tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of shp-1 to the phosphorylated itims , which next would mediate dephosphorylation of nonmuscle cell myosin iia to promote fusion and formation of osteoclasts .",
            "this hypothesis is contrasted by a study of sirp mutant mice , expressing a truncated nonsignaling sirp cytoplasmic domain , where cultures of bone marrow cells generated the same number of osteoclasts of the same size , as found in wild - type bone marrow cultures . the important observation made in",
            "the latter study was that osteoclasts generated in sirp mutant mice had an increased bone resorbing activity , suggesting that sirp negatively regulates this function in osteoclasts .",
            "the contradictory findings presented regarding a possible role of signaling through either cd47 or sirp during fusion of preosteoclasts and formation of multinucleated osteoclasts must also be put in context of the originally presented hypothesis that the interaction between cd47 and sirp may mainly facilitate cell fusion by promoting cell - cell adhesion and bringing the plasma membranes of two cells close enough to facilitate cell fusion . here",
            "it has also been highlighted that cd47 may interact with the shorter sirp isoform having only one extracellular igv domain , which would further reduce the distance between two opposing cellular membranes where cell fusion could take place .",
            "cd47 can regulate many important physiological cellular mechanisms by interacting with integrins , tsp-1 , or sirp. as outlined above , much knowledge has been collected over the past two decades , but much is probably still to be discovered regarding the functions of this protein .",
            "there are several areas where one can assume that further progress may result in new novel ways to interfere with biological mechanisms in pathological conditions .",
            "although cd47 is expressed by virtually all cells in the body , in healthy as well as pathological cells , the data so far indicates that cd47-induced apoptosis may still be a way to kill , for example , tumor cells , since it appears that tumor cells and activated cells are much more sensitive to this cell death mechanism than nonactivated nave cells or hematopoietic stem cells .",
            "the ability of cd47 to inhibit phagocytosis is clearly an important mechanism whereby innate cells as macrophages or dendritic cells can discriminate between self and non - self , and maintain tolerance to host cells . in the field of xenotransplantation , further development and research to create xenotransplants carrying human cd47 may prove important to obtain even better conditions where xenogenic cell , tissues , or organs can be tolerated when transplanted into humans . in the field of cancer research , where tumor cells may express higher levels of cd47 as a way of avoiding phagocytosis and clearance by phagocytic cells , and where cd47-blocking antibodies have been shown to promote clearance of and to reduce the dissemination of tumor cells , brings hope that careful development of reagents that can block the cd47/sirp interaction may indeed be useful to treat many forms of cancer without having too much of a negative side effect in terms of inducing clearance of host cells .",
            "also in the field of bone research , one may suggest that manipulation of the interaction between cd47 and sirp may be a way to modulate bone resorption and to prevent osteoporosis .",
            "however , data showing that these two proteins may also be involved in regulating bone formation   indicate that manipulation of this signaling system in bone tissue may be more complicated ."

            "178,500 persons were identified with hemophilia across 106 countries , of whom only 16.1% had hemophilia b.1 hemophilia b is an x - linked disease .",
            "missense , frameshift , and nonsense mutations are the most frequently seen , and deletions are rarely described.2 the severity of the disease is related to clotting factor levels .",
            "the disease is classified as severe , moderate , or mild when the clotting factor levels are < 1 , 15 , or > 5 , respectively.3 people with mild - to - moderate hemophilia rarely bleed unless after trauma or invasive procedures .",
            "frequency and severity of bleeding is greatest in severe hemophilia b. data from the us show that only 36% of patients with hemophilia b have the severe form of the disease.4 recurrent and spontaneous bleeding into joints and/or soft tissues since early infancy are hallmarks of severity .",
            "gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding can be life threatening.3 repeated bleeding into joints without adequate treatment can result in crippling chronic joint disease , pain , and reduced quality of life.3,58 the introduction and availability of factor concentrate has dramatically improved the treatment of hemophilia with a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality , and an increase in quality of life.9 early on - demand treatment of acute bleeding episodes decreases the number of joint deformities compared to untreated or minimally treated patient.10,11 nevertheless , long - term musculoskeletal follow - up of on - demand treatment in hemophilia showed a progressive deterioration of the joint functions in these patients . as on - demand treatment appears to be clearly suboptimal , prophylaxis  meaning preventive use of clotting factor given at regular intervals  was proposed and adopted since several decades in sweden.12 in 1994 , the medical and scientific advisory council ( masac ) of the us national hemophilia foundation issued guidelines stating that prophylaxis with twice- or thrice - weekly fix infusion , at a dose of 2540 iu / kg , should be considered the optimal treatment for hemophilia b.13 the european pediatric network for haemophilia management define primary prophylaxis as regular treatment started after first episode of bleeding and secondary prophylaxis as regular or intermittent regular treatment started after several episodes of bleeding.14,15 the world federation of hemophila ( wfh ) guidelines recommend prophylaxis to prevent bleed and joint destruction and preserve normal musculoskeletal function .",
            "moreover , it is advisable to give it to all patients before performing any activities associated with an increased risk of trauma .",
            "prophylaxis should be the state - of - art treatment.3 despite the guidelines , prophylaxis has not been universally adopted .",
            "medical , psychosocial , and cost controversies limit the implementation of prophylaxis.16 in the canadian 2006 survey , only 32% of patients with severe hemophilia b received prophylaxis , while 69% of patients with hemophilia a received the treatment .",
            "this difference was particularly notable in the 02 years age - group ( 17% in hemophilia b versus 53% in hemophilia a ) and also present in patients > 18 years of age ( 20% versus 55% ) .",
            "this difference could be explained by a less severe phenotype , less frequent joint bleeds , later presentation in life , paucity of clinical trials studying the use of prophylaxis , or simply a current treatment tradition.17 moderate hemophilia b is diagnosed much more frequently than the severe ( 37% versus 27% ) form .",
            "positivity to cross - reacting material , which corresponds to measurable level of fix antigen in plasma , is frequently observed in hemophilia b. this could be explained by the frequency of non - null mutation .",
            "most mutations in hemophilia b are missense mutations and these result in mild - to - moderate form of the disease and account for variable factor levels in plasma.18 studies reporting prophylactic use of fix in hemophilia b patients are limited in number , and concern mainly small populations within larger clinical trials.1922 benefits of prophylaxis remain questionable even if intuitively the tendency is in favor.23,24 there is currently no evidence to suggest or refute prophylaxis.25 following a 6-month regimen of prophylaxis with recombinant fix ( rix ) , patients achieved significantly meaningful improvements in physical health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) .",
            "those who switched from intermittent prophylaxis to on - demand prophylaxis experienced improvements in physical and mental hrqol.26 there is no general agreement on the optimal prophylaxis regimen , and some schemes differ from those proposed by the consensus perspectives on prophylactic therapy for hemophilia , held in london , september 2021 , 2002.14 given the paucity of controlled clinical trials regarding prophylaxis in subjects with hemophilia b , choice of treatment approach is limited to clinical judgment , clinical experience , and interpretation of currently available data based on pharmacokinetics ( pk ) , bleeding phenotype , and type of fix used . in recent years , greater",
            "attention has been paid to the pk of coagulation factor , dosing intervals , and trough levels .",
            "pk parameters had an increasing role in management choice even if there was no clear evidence on clinical efficacy .",
            "they are routinely measured in clinical practice to guide treatment dosing , particularly for primary prophylaxis , and in connection with surgery.27 in 2011 , the european medicines agency considered appropriate incremental recovery , half - life , area under the curve ( auc ) , and clearance to be the most important surrogate end points for efficacy of fix products.28 pk parameters of fix are not well characterized or widely investigated .",
            "the pk of fix are more complicated than those of fviii , and also differ between plasma - derived and recombinant forms resulting in variation between studies .",
            "fix has a longer half - life in the circulation than fviii.29 according to sampling time , the half - life of fix could be different .",
            "after administration of 75 iu / kg of nonacog alfa to patients aged 1261 years , the half - life was reported as 2224 hours when sampled at 72 hours,30 and after administration of 50 iu / g , the half - life was reported as 34 hours when sampled at 96 hours.31 a sampling schedule at 48 hours gives shorter half - life . in powell s study , the residual fix observed 1 week after administration of fix is supportive of longer half - life.31 strategy to achieve prophylaxis is to maintain the plasma level of factor activity at or above 1 u / dl.3 in current bio - assays , accuracy can be expected to be rather poor at the conventional target of 1 u / dl , which is the lower limit of the assays.32 this issue with assaying was clearly demonstrated by the discrepancies in factor levels in patients with mild - to - moderate and severe hemophilia in the uk national external quality assessment service data.33 furthermore , measuring plasma fix activity may not fully reflect the hemostatic efficacy of infused fix .",
            "fix is a small protein ( 55 kda ) with access to both intravascular and extravascular compartments.34 a number of clinical observations in hemophilia b patients suggest the presence of extravascular  pool  of fix .",
            "continuous infusion of fix results in reduced dose requirement of fix to maintain a level of 100%.35 furthermore , there are experimental data demonstrating that fix binds to collagen iv .",
            "this may be a source of hemostatically active fix which is not measurable by plasma assays.34,36 experiments on baboons showed that perfusion of excess bovine fix increased the circulating fix proportionally .",
            "reanalysis of these data suggests that the extravascular component contains at least threefold more fix than that present in the circulation.34 two experiments on mouse demonstrated the affinity of fix to collagen iv and its impact on hemostasis . in a knock - in mouse model expressing a fix variant with reduced affinity to collagen iv , hemostasis was delayed despite high levels of fix .",
            "bolus infusion of fix variant with enhanced collagen affinity demonstrates a prolonged hemostatic effect in hemophilia b mouse .",
            "this hemostatic effect persists days after plasma levels reach less than 1%.37 fix ( and fixa ) binds rapidly and reversibly to vascular endothelium and subendothelial extracellular matrix .",
            "this is mediated by the interaction of specific residues in the fix gla domain with collagen iv , located predominantly in the basement membrane.38,39 the clinical significance of maintaining a 1% trough level is mainly applicable in fviii deficiency .",
            "such evidence does not exist in fix deficiency and is widely debated.40 in a cohort of 64 patients ( 51 hemophilia a and 13 hemophilia b ) described by ahnstrom et al , some patients did not bleed with a trough level less than 1% , while others bled with a trough level higher than 3% .",
            "they found that there is no relationship between factor level and incidence of bleed and that the correlation was very weak .",
            "authors suggest that dosing in prophylactic treatment should be individualized.41 due to interindividual variations in pk parameters , targeting a particular trough level may not be appropriate for every individual.41 relationship between fix trough levels and therapeutic outcomes has not been confirmed in clinical trials.40 baseline factor levels are not the only determinants of bleeding phenotype in hemophilia . with the same factor level",
            ", the severity and frequency of bleeding may be different for people with hemophilia.42 in hemophilia b , where limited data exist , there is a need to strike a balance between clinical and pk end points in the evaluation of clinical efficacy.43 in hemophilia , bleeding frequency is considered a key indicator of the efficacy of the treatment regimen . the hemophilia severity score ( hss ) has been developed as a method to predict bleeding score in hemophilia.44 it includes in its assessment the annual joint bleeding rate , annual factor consumption , and wfh orthopedic score .",
            "this score was used by vyas et al to evaluate 178 hemophilia patients without inhibitors in a single us center ( hemophilia a [ n=139 ] , hemophilia b [ n=39 ] ) .",
            "they found heterogeneity of hemophilia phenotype and widespread variability in the hss values of patients with the same baseline factor activity.45 data from a single - center cohort study of 171 patients with severe hemophilia a and b in the netherlands demonstrated the importance of clinical issues in determining the phenotype .",
            "they found that age at first joint bleed was an indicator of bleeding pattern.46 there was higher annual clotting factor consumption in subjects who experienced a joint bleed at an early age comparing to those who experienced later in life.47 according to the united kingdom haemophilia centres doctors organisation ( ukhcdo ) annual report , a large variation in rates of clotting factor concentrate consumption in patients with same diagnosis was also widely observed.48 clinical assessment of the frequency and severity of bleeds remain an important measure of the efficacy of treatment for hemophilia b. the role of pk - guided therapy and its relationship to clinical efficacy remain open issues to be established .",
            "historically , effective treatment of hemophilia b started with fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrate .",
            "in the early 1990s , highly purified plasma - derived factor concentrate was introduced.49,50 since then , large numbers have become commercially available.51 improvement in sourcing and purification procedure of blood components and the introduction of different steps of viral inactivation increased the safety of plasma - derived concentrates.52 despite these improvements , concerns remain and transfusion - transmitted emerging pathogens like prion and unencapsulated virus should not be overlooked.5356 in 1997 , the first purified rfix product , nonacog alfa , received us food and drug administration ( fda ) approval followed in 2014 by another rfix product , bax326 .",
            "these rfix products have a lower risk of pathogenic contamination and have low activated fix activity , which confers low thrombogenic potential in humans.2 traditionally , in vivo recovery ( ivr ) is the parameter used to characterize the pk properties of coagulation factors.57 following bolus injection , recombinant protein has lower ivr compared to plasma - derived fix .",
            "terminal half - life is similar for the two products ( 1719 hours).40,58,59 pk studies that enrolled 308 subjects with hemophilia b in three comparative studies showed that the ivr of rfix is approximately one - third to one - half that of plasma - derived fix.58,60,61 this disparity in ivr was also noted by kisker et al in a double - blind crossover study of plasma - derived fix and rfix in 15 subjects older than 5 years with severe hemophilia b.62 this disparity could be related to baseline fix levels , body weight , and age.58,63 while some individuals have identical recoveries with both types of concentrates , others have pronounced differences.64 a recent survey in italy indicated that plasma - derived fix and rfix are used in similar doses with similar outcomes.65 despite disparity in recovery , recombinant coagulant factors are nowadays the preferred treatment option for hemophiliacs and , in particular , for pediatric patients mainly in light of the wide margin of safety and efficacy .",
            "wfh  who and nnh propose the twice- or thrice - weekly prophylaxis dose of 50 iu / kg . this regimen was extrapolated from the fviii prophylaxis experience , early pk data , and the few studies done on fix . in the original phase 3 nonacog alfa study in previously treated subjects aged 12 years , the mean dose was 40.3 iu / kg administered 23 times weekly.22 in the phase 3 trial of reformulated nonacog alfa in previously treated subjects , the median dose was 51.7 iu / kg administered 23 times weekly.30 frequency and dose of prophylaxis were determined by the investigator in these two studies . both the studies demonstrated safety and efficacy in persons with hemophilia b. however , rigorous regimens of prophylaxis are difficult and adherence remains a problem.66 only 45% of individuals with severe hemophilia b are currently receiving prophylaxis in the us.67 cost of clotting factor is certainly a main obstacle for the implementation of such management .",
            "it is the largest predictor of overall cost in the care of people with hemophilia.68,69 however , the leading reasons for lack of adherence to the prescribed regimen are time consumption , convenient access to peripheral vein , forgetfulness , and the feeling of being healthy with the disappearance of symptoms with time.70,71 many patients find it very difficult to spend 1520 minutes every morning to mix and infuse intravenous factor .",
            "this is certainly more difficult in children where venous access could be difficult and where central venous access devices are associated with the concomitant risk of infection and thrombosis . in an european survey carried out by de moerloose between october 2005 and september 2006 , an interview was conducted with 30 patients in each of six european countries ( france , germany , italy , spain , sweden , and the uk ) , resulting in a total of 180 patients .",
            "the feeling of reduction , fluctuation , or disappearance of symptoms was cited in 38% of cases , forgetfulness in 36% , lack of time for the treatment in 30% , and convenience in 30% .",
            "forgetfulness was the reason most often cited by patients on prophylaxis ( 46%).72 therefore , new approaches of management must be proposed to achieve adherence and make patients lives easier . despite recent promising success in gene therapy for hemophilia b ,",

            "otherwise , the two studies were conducted in previously treated patients and 92% of the patients included in the kavakli study had tertiary prophylaxis .",

            "effect of switching from twice - weekly to once - weekly prophylaxis is not yet known .",
            "in 1994 , the medical and scientific advisory council ( masac ) of the us national hemophilia foundation issued guidelines stating that prophylaxis with twice- or thrice - weekly fix infusion , at a dose of 2540 iu / kg , should be considered the optimal treatment for hemophilia b.13 the european pediatric network for haemophilia management define primary prophylaxis as regular treatment started after first episode of bleeding and secondary prophylaxis as regular or intermittent regular treatment started after several episodes of bleeding.14,15 the world federation of hemophila ( wfh ) guidelines recommend prophylaxis to prevent bleed and joint destruction and preserve normal musculoskeletal function . moreover , it is advisable to give it to all patients before performing any activities associated with an increased risk of trauma .",
            "prophylaxis should be the state - of - art treatment.3 despite the guidelines , prophylaxis has not been universally adopted .",
            "medical , psychosocial , and cost controversies limit the implementation of prophylaxis.16 in the canadian 2006 survey , only 32% of patients with severe hemophilia b received prophylaxis , while 69% of patients with hemophilia a received the treatment .",
            "this difference was particularly notable in the 02 years age - group ( 17% in hemophilia b versus 53% in hemophilia a ) and also present in patients > 18 years of age ( 20% versus 55% ) .",
            "this difference could be explained by a less severe phenotype , less frequent joint bleeds , later presentation in life , paucity of clinical trials studying the use of prophylaxis , or simply a current treatment tradition.17 moderate hemophilia b is diagnosed much more frequently than the severe ( 37% versus 27% ) form .",
            "positivity to cross - reacting material , which corresponds to measurable level of fix antigen in plasma , is frequently observed in hemophilia b. this could be explained by the frequency of non - null mutation .",
            "most mutations in hemophilia b are missense mutations and these result in mild - to - moderate form of the disease and account for variable factor levels in plasma.18 studies reporting prophylactic use of fix in hemophilia b patients are limited in number , and concern mainly small populations within larger clinical trials.1922 benefits of prophylaxis remain questionable even if intuitively the tendency is in favor.23,24 there is currently no evidence to suggest or refute prophylaxis.25 following a 6-month regimen of prophylaxis with recombinant fix ( rix ) , patients achieved significantly meaningful improvements in physical health - related quality of life ( hrqol )",
            ". those who switched from intermittent prophylaxis to on - demand prophylaxis experienced improvements in physical and mental hrqol.26",
            "there is no general agreement on the optimal prophylaxis regimen , and some schemes differ from those proposed by the consensus perspectives on prophylactic therapy for hemophilia , held in london , september 2021 , 2002.14 given the paucity of controlled clinical trials regarding prophylaxis in subjects with hemophilia b , choice of treatment approach is limited to clinical judgment , clinical experience , and interpretation of currently available data based on pharmacokinetics ( pk ) , bleeding phenotype , and type of fix used .",
            "in recent years , greater attention has been paid to the pk of coagulation factor , dosing intervals , and trough levels .",
            "pk parameters had an increasing role in management choice even if there was no clear evidence on clinical efficacy .",
            "they are routinely measured in clinical practice to guide treatment dosing , particularly for primary prophylaxis , and in connection with surgery.27 in 2011 , the european medicines agency considered appropriate incremental recovery , half - life , area under the curve ( auc ) , and clearance to be the most important surrogate end points for efficacy of fix products.28 pk parameters of fix are not well characterized or widely investigated .",
            "the pk of fix are more complicated than those of fviii , and also differ between plasma - derived and recombinant forms resulting in variation between studies .",
            "fix has a longer half - life in the circulation than fviii.29 according to sampling time , the half - life of fix could be different .",
            "after administration of 75 iu / kg of nonacog alfa to patients aged 1261 years , the half - life was reported as 2224 hours when sampled at 72 hours,30 and after administration of 50 iu / g , the half - life was reported as 34 hours when sampled at 96 hours.31 a sampling schedule at 48 hours gives shorter half - life . in powell s study , the residual fix observed 1 week after administration of fix is supportive of longer half - life.31 strategy to achieve prophylaxis is to maintain the plasma level of factor activity at or above 1 u / dl.3 in current bio - assays , accuracy can be expected to be rather poor at the conventional target of 1 u / dl , which is the lower limit of the assays.32 this issue with assaying was clearly demonstrated by the discrepancies in factor levels in patients with mild - to - moderate and severe hemophilia in the uk national external quality assessment service data.33 furthermore , measuring plasma fix activity may not fully reflect the hemostatic efficacy of infused fix .",
            "fix is a small protein ( 55 kda ) with access to both intravascular and extravascular compartments.34 a number of clinical observations in hemophilia b patients suggest the presence of extravascular  pool  of fix .",
            "continuous infusion of fix results in reduced dose requirement of fix to maintain a level of 100%.35 furthermore , there are experimental data demonstrating that fix binds to collagen iv .",
            "this may be a source of hemostatically active fix which is not measurable by plasma assays.34,36 experiments on baboons showed that perfusion of excess bovine fix increased the circulating fix proportionally .",
            "reanalysis of these data suggests that the extravascular component contains at least threefold more fix than that present in the circulation.34 two experiments on mouse demonstrated the affinity of fix to collagen iv and its impact on hemostasis . in a knock - in mouse model expressing a fix variant with reduced affinity to collagen iv , hemostasis was delayed despite high levels of fix .",
            "bolus infusion of fix variant with enhanced collagen affinity demonstrates a prolonged hemostatic effect in hemophilia b mouse .",
            "this hemostatic effect persists days after plasma levels reach less than 1%.37 fix ( and fixa ) binds rapidly and reversibly to vascular endothelium and subendothelial extracellular matrix .",
            "this is mediated by the interaction of specific residues in the fix gla domain with collagen iv , located predominantly in the basement membrane.38,39 the clinical significance of maintaining a 1% trough level is mainly applicable in fviii deficiency .",
            "such evidence does not exist in fix deficiency and is widely debated.40 in a cohort of 64 patients ( 51 hemophilia a and 13 hemophilia b ) described by ahnstrom et al , some patients did not bleed with a trough level less than 1% , while others bled with a trough level higher than 3% .",
            "they found that there is no relationship between factor level and incidence of bleed and that the correlation was very weak .",
            "authors suggest that dosing in prophylactic treatment should be individualized.41 due to interindividual variations in pk parameters , targeting a particular trough level may not be appropriate for every individual.41 relationship between fix trough levels and therapeutic outcomes has not been confirmed in clinical trials.40",
            "baseline factor levels are not the only determinants of bleeding phenotype in hemophilia . with the same factor level",
            ", the severity and frequency of bleeding may be different for people with hemophilia.42 in hemophilia b , where limited data exist , there is a need to strike a balance between clinical and pk end points in the evaluation of clinical efficacy.43 in hemophilia , bleeding frequency is considered a key indicator of the efficacy of the treatment regimen . the hemophilia severity score ( hss ) has been developed as a method to predict bleeding score in hemophilia.44 it includes in its assessment the annual joint bleeding rate , annual factor consumption , and wfh orthopedic score .",
            "this score was used by vyas et al to evaluate 178 hemophilia patients without inhibitors in a single us center ( hemophilia a [ n=139 ] , hemophilia b [ n=39 ] ) .",
            "they found heterogeneity of hemophilia phenotype and widespread variability in the hss values of patients with the same baseline factor activity.45 data from a single - center cohort study of 171 patients with severe hemophilia a and b in the netherlands demonstrated the importance of clinical issues in determining the phenotype .",
            "they found that age at first joint bleed was an indicator of bleeding pattern.46 there was higher annual clotting factor consumption in subjects who experienced a joint bleed at an early age comparing to those who experienced later in life.47 according to the united kingdom haemophilia centres doctors organisation ( ukhcdo ) annual report , a large variation in rates of clotting factor concentrate consumption in patients with same diagnosis was also widely observed.48 clinical assessment of the frequency and severity of bleeds remain an important measure of the efficacy of treatment for hemophilia b. the role of pk - guided therapy and its relationship to clinical efficacy remain open issues to be established .",
            "historically , effective treatment of hemophilia b started with fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrate . in the early 1990s ,",
            "highly purified plasma - derived factor concentrate was introduced.49,50 since then , large numbers have become commercially available.51 improvement in sourcing and purification procedure of blood components and the introduction of different steps of viral inactivation increased the safety of plasma - derived concentrates.52 despite these improvements , concerns remain and transfusion - transmitted emerging pathogens like prion and unencapsulated virus should not be overlooked.5356 in 1997 , the first purified rfix product , nonacog alfa , received us food and drug administration ( fda ) approval followed in 2014 by another rfix product , bax326 .",
            "these rfix products have a lower risk of pathogenic contamination and have low activated fix activity , which confers low thrombogenic potential in humans.2 traditionally , in vivo recovery ( ivr ) is the parameter used to characterize the pk properties of coagulation factors.57 following bolus injection , recombinant protein has lower ivr compared to plasma - derived fix .",
            "terminal half - life is similar for the two products ( 1719 hours).40,58,59 pk studies that enrolled 308 subjects with hemophilia b in three comparative studies showed that the ivr of rfix is approximately one - third to one - half that of plasma - derived fix.58,60,61 this disparity in ivr was also noted by kisker et al in a double - blind crossover study of plasma - derived fix and rfix in 15 subjects older than 5 years with severe hemophilia b.62 this disparity could be related to baseline fix levels , body weight , and age.58,63 while some individuals have identical recoveries with both types of concentrates , others have pronounced differences.64 a recent survey in italy indicated that plasma - derived fix and rfix are used in similar doses with similar outcomes.65 despite disparity in recovery , recombinant coagulant factors are nowadays the preferred treatment option for hemophiliacs and , in particular , for pediatric patients mainly in light of the wide margin of safety and efficacy .",
            "wfh  who and nnh propose the twice- or thrice - weekly prophylaxis dose of 50 iu / kg . this regimen was extrapolated from the fviii prophylaxis experience , early pk data , and the few studies done on fix . in the original phase 3 nonacog alfa study in previously treated subjects aged 12 years , the mean dose was 40.3 iu / kg administered 23 times weekly.22 in the phase 3 trial of reformulated nonacog alfa in previously treated subjects , the median dose was 51.7 iu / kg administered 23 times weekly.30 frequency and dose of prophylaxis were determined by the investigator in these two studies . both the studies demonstrated safety and efficacy in persons with hemophilia b. however , rigorous regimens of prophylaxis are difficult and adherence remains a problem.66 only 45% of individuals with severe hemophilia b are currently receiving prophylaxis in the us.67 cost of clotting factor is certainly a main obstacle for the implementation of such management .",
            "it is the largest predictor of overall cost in the care of people with hemophilia.68,69 however , the leading reasons for lack of adherence to the prescribed regimen are time consumption , convenient access to peripheral vein , forgetfulness , and the feeling of being healthy with the disappearance of symptoms with time.70,71 many patients find it very difficult to spend 1520 minutes every morning to mix and infuse intravenous factor .",
            "this is certainly more difficult in children where venous access could be difficult and where central venous access devices are associated with the concomitant risk of infection and thrombosis . in an european survey carried out by de moerloose between october 2005 and september 2006 ,",

            "diagnoses included mood disorders , anxiety disorders , adjustment disorders , and psychiatric disorders due to medical conditions , with two of the subjects found to have more than one disorder .",
            "no psychotic disorders were identified ( see table 3 ) .   throughout the six - month study ,",
            "7,722 interventions were provided to the 32 subjects , which is an average of 241 ( 108.6 ) interventions per subject and 14.0 ( 4.6 ) interventions per contact .",
            "most interventions provided were surveillance interventions ( 6,526 ; 81.46% ) , followed by teaching , guidance , and counseling interventions ( 1,196 ; 15.49% ) and case management interventions ( 236 ; 3.06% ) .",

            "when evaluated with respect to when they were administered per the study 's intervention phases , the low distress / apn only subsample appeared to receive the most interventions per contact at initiation ( baseline ) , but the least for the remainder of the study period , in comparison to the other ( high distress ) subsamples .",

            "no differences were noted in numbers of contacts , length of the contacts , or whether the contacts were delivered in - person or by telephone among the three subsamples .",
            "examination of the interventions provided with respect to the four problem domains revealed several interesting findings .",
            "interventions administered for environmental problems were significantly higher for the high distress / apn only / refused pcln subsample than the other two subsamples , although this finding occurred among a very small sample .",
            "in addition , differences in numbers of interventions per contact for psychosocial problems approached significance , with the high distress / apn only / refused pcln subsample appearing to receive the fewest in comparison to the other two subsamples . a larger sample may provide clarity as to the significance of this observation ( see table 4 ) .  ",
            "along the study trajectory , intervention pattern differences were observed relative to numbers of interventions per contact provided within each problem domain . in particular ,",
            "the high distress / apn plus pcln subsample initially received the most interventions for psychosocial domain problems than the other two subsamples , but this number remained relatively constant throughout the study period .",
            "in contrast , the high distress / apn only / refused subsample , and low distress / apn only subsample appeared to receive increasingly more interventions for psychosocial problems through the end of the study , with this phenomenon markedly apparent for the low distress / apn only subsample ( see figure 4 ) .",
            "interventions for physiological problems were highest at baseline among the low distress / apn only subsample , and this subsample as well as the high distress / apn plus pcln subsample received a steady reduction in interventions per contact for physiological problems as the study progressed .",
            "in contrast , the high distress / apn only / refused pcln subsample did not experience a similar reduction in interventions for physiological problems as the study progressed , receiving the most by the termination phase ( see figure 5 ) .",
            "in addition , interventions for health - related behavior domain problems remained relatively constant for all three subsamples as the study progressed , but patterns may indicate a trend of diminishing numbers of interventions along the study trajectory provided to the high distress / apn plus pcln and low distress / apn only subsamples .",
            "a similar pattern was not evident for the high distress / apn only / refused pcln subsample , who received a relatively constant number throughout the study ( see figure 6 ) .",
            "the first limitations were related to the study 's use of data by secondary analysis of previously - collected data . since the data had been designed for a different purpose , they required content analysis to quantify them into discrete units for comparison using the omaha system . retrospectively categorizing existing data",
            "did not allow for further clarification in several instances where , as they were described , signs and symptoms were not able to be straightforwardly coded into omaha system problems .",
            "this issue highlights a semantic limitation with the omaha system , which was particularly evident in trying to determine how to classify the symptom  fatigue .   ",
            "since fatigue was associated with several omaha problems , including sleep and rest , circulation , digestion / hydration , and medication regimen ( when fatigue was considered a chemotherapy side effect ) , the primary investigator needed to identify the suspected source of the fatigue to correctly identify it as the symptom indicative of a particular omaha problem .",
            "this was sometimes problematic , because this detail of information was not always evident from the research records .",
            "it was therefore possible that errors were made in identifying the correct omaha problem associated with fatigue for those patients who experienced this symptom .     ",
            "the dt , one of the primary independent variables used to determine subsample assignment , has not undergone substantial cross - cultural validation , and therefore its ability to measure distress among subjects of various ethnicities and levels of education is not known .",
            "assignment of subjects into the three subsamples based on subjects ' dt scores , as well as their consent for the pcln intervention , resulted in the subsample with low distress ( low distress / apn only ) being the only subsample with nonwhite subjects .",
            "it is also not known whether additional factors not explored prior to the analysis may have been associated with these subjects ' decision to decline the pcln intervention . in order to reduce the artificial effect potentially introduced by dissimilar group characteristics that may have been associated with reasons to accept or decline the pcln referral , a more extensive exploration of baseline and situational factors would have been needed .",
            "in addition , a larger and more diverse sample would have provided more reliable evidence as to whether the factors education or race may have influenced the degree of psychological distress or the propensity to decline or accept pcln care .  ",
            "finally , the sample was derived from a larger sample of women from a single comprehensive cancer center who were being treated for ovarian cancer .",
            "the findings therefore are limited in their ability to be generalized to other samples of women with ovarian cancer .",
            "much of the research on ovarian cancer , including the current study , has been conducted on women who were white and generally older than age 55",
            ". however , the significant finding associating nonwhite race and lower education levels among the current study 's low distress / apn only subsample begs for exploration of the influence of race and education on psychological distress among women with cancer , using larger more racially diverse studies .",
            "further , although the study 's results support previous research identifying various symptoms as prevalent among women with ovarian cancer , the novel use of the omaha system identified unique issues which were not typically explored among this population of women .",
            "specifically , the high distress / apn only / refused pcln subsample may have been less forthcoming with problems and may also have been more distressed due to environmental problems such as issues with income and residence than either the high distress / apn plus pcln or the low distress / apn only subsample .",
            "although such environmental issues are not typically associated with ovarian cancer , in the context of difficult ovarian cancer treatment , they may have contributed to already high distress levels .",
            "accurate examination of the unpleasant symptoms and problems experienced by women undergoing ovarian cancer treatment should also explore additional sources of their distress so that appropriately targeted treatments may be initiated .         ",
            "one - fourth of the women with high distress refused pcln care ; however , this ratio was better than has been reported by previous studies among cancer patients . the therapeutic relationship established between the apns and their assigned subjects",
            "improvements in distress among cancer patients has been positively linked to better adherence to cancer therapies , it may be especially important to provide a mechanism for certain patients to establish such therapeutic relationships as a component of their chemotherapy plans , either within the clinic setting , or perhaps as a homecare adjunct to chemotherapy .  ",
            "the use of the distress thermometer resulted in 24 of 32 subjects reporting high distress .",
            "this screening mechanism prompted mental health evaluations to be performed for eighteen women , which revealed that eight of the women were suffering from clinically significant psychiatric conditions , while ten of the women were evaluated as not having clinically significant psychiatric conditions .",
            "the most frequent conditions identified included anxiety , mood disorders ( depression ) , adjustment disorders , and psychiatric disorders due to medical conditions . in this manner , the use of the dt in clinical practice , as endorsed by the nccn guidelines , may be seen as effective in identifying and treating potentially serious psychiatric conditions among cancer patients . since the dt was easy to use and has shown good reliability with the ces - d and similar measure of psychological distress , it may be advantageous for patients to complete the dt prior to every chemotherapy session , rather than at a single time at the onset of treatment , as occurred in the current study .",
            "more frequent monitoring of distress could improve the accuracy of psychiatric problem identification by offering opportunities to compare previous ratings , while also potentially targeting psychiatric evaluation and treatment for those who need it the most .     ",
            "the omaha system offered a unique method of capturing the broad array of patient problems within all four potential problem domains without simply identifying symptoms or targeting a single area of clinical concern among the universe of possibilities .",
            "the study findings show the complexity of the ovarian cancer patients ' needs , the intensity of nursing care , and the value of a classification system to capture that description .",
            "the omaha system also ensured a high degree of problem specificity by requiring that each active problem be counted only when clearly linked with at least one omaha system - defined sign or symptom .",
            "many of the omaha system problems found closely resembled problems identified among other samples of women with ovarian cancer using different measurement systems .",
            "however , the broad range of problems identified enhanced this body of knowledge by also identifying the effects of nontreatment issues sometimes experienced by women with ovarian cancer that may contribute to psychological distress .",
            "a major semantic problem occurred with respect to the issue of fatigue and may require a more in - depth examination of the omaha system 's ability to capture in detail the etiology and clinical significance of this problem .  ",
            "interventions identified using the omaha system were classified into surveillance , teaching , guidance , and counseling , and case management interventions , with surveillance comprising the largest category .",
            "although the three subsamples received relatively similar interventions within the intervention categories throughout study period , by the end of the six - month period , the high distress / apn only / refused pcln subjects received more interventions overall than subjects in the other two samples .",
            "this finding also points to the possibility that this highly distressed subsample may not have initially been ready to discuss psychological issues and may have required additional time to feel comfortable disclosing sensitive information to the apns .",
            "the six - month study period was only beginning to provide the opportunity for them to develop therapeutic relationships sufficiently meaningful to allow for such disclosure .",
            "this finding suggested that a six - month time period may be insufficient to allow some patients , even highly distressed ones , to accept certain interventions , but longer - term relationships among patients and clinicians may enhance this ability .   ",
            "based on the current study 's significant findings and methodological limitations , the following suggestions for future research are presented .",
            "first , the dt requires additional testing for reliability , validity , and stability among a racially diverse sample with different levels of education and cancer types .",
            "such testing should also include sensitivity and specificity testing to reliably evaluate its use as a screening tool throughout the cancer treatment process in order to fully support its universal usage per nccn distress management guidelines .  ",
            "second , although the omaha system is commonly used in practice within the homecare and other settings , more studies using the omaha system exclusively among cancer patients may provide evidence as to the unique nature of problems experienced by them .",
            "one area in need of careful evaluation concerns the issue of fatigue among cancer patients .",
            "the omaha system may offer a viable tool to uncover contributory and mediating factors associated with this elusive problem .",
            "in addition , semantic study of this problem for clarity in categorizing it according to omaha system criteria is in order to improve standardization in documentation .",
            "third , the longitudinal nature of the current study provided an opportunity for the investigator to examine linkages between patient problems and apn interventions , while incorporating systems characteristics such as the timing of apn contacts and the use of the dt .",
            "further studies which link patient problems , nursing interventions , and outcomes are essential in order for nurses to refine their practice through the merits of evidence .",
            "this need is especially important as populations become more diverse and complex , and as the shrinking nursing workforce struggles to meet patients ' needs for quality health care .",
            "although secondary analysis was an inexpensive and convenient method for designing and completing this study , future studies among patients with cancer , using the omaha system in a prospective manner may prove more accurate in correctly identifying omaha problems related to specific symptoms and would eliminate the need for content analysis to categorize the data .  ",
            "in addition to the problem and nursing intervention schemes , the omaha system provides the opportunity to utilize the problems rating scale for outcomes scheme , which would be helpful in determining linkages between patient problems , nursing interventions , and patient outcomes .",
            "this scheme would enable evaluation of changes within three subscales of patient conditions in relation to specific omaha problems :   knowledge ( patient 's understanding about a problem ) , behaviors ( patient 's actions / responses in relation to a problem ) , and status ( wellness or illness in relation to a problem ) using a five - point rating scale for each subscale .  ",
            "finally , it is possible that extraneous factors not identified may have influenced patients ' inclinations to accept or decline pcln or other mental health referrals .",
            "the analysis plan for future studies will need to adjust for these factors , and the results from these studies will need to be evaluated within the context of how these factors versus the intervention alone may account for the results so that the possibility of an artificial effect imposed by these factors is minimized .",
            "the current study highlighted clinical outcomes resulting from distress screening for women in active treatment for ovarian cancer .",
            "the dt isolated unique phenomena among women who reported varying levels of distress at baseline , which may be helpful to clinicians who care for this cancer population .",
            "women with low distress ( the low distress / apn only subsample ) appeared to be very open to communicating their needs and concerns , were able to articulate their needs to apns , and became active participants in achieving their health goals , as evidenced by the clear reduction in their problems and interventions as the study period progressed . those with high distress who were willing to receive services to treat this distress ( the high distress / apn plus pcln subsample ) also appeared to receive valuable assistance in caring for their health during the cancer treatment period through interactions with oncology and psychiatric apns .",
            "several of these women were identified to have psychiatric conditions worthy of further treatment and were referred appropriately . however , the high distress / apn only / refused pcln subsample presented challenges unique to this subsample . these women may have experienced more environmental problems contributing to their distress ; therefore , clinical settings need to provide ample opportunities for women to receive assistance in meeting financial , residence , and employment needs , which although not directly related to their disease process , may seriously degrade quality of life during already challenging health events .",
            "clinicians need to be keenly aware of such patients and interact with them with particular sensitivity through continued support and gentle , repeated reminders of how they may be helped .  ",
            "the dt was a simple screening tool which identified 24 patients in distress at baseline , with eight evaluated as needing further mental health treatment .",
            "the nccn guideline suggests serial dt screenings to be useful for clinicians to use at baseline and throughout the treatment process , so that areas of distress may be identified and addressed promptly",
            ". this would be particularly helpful among women who may be reticent to disclose such problems in conversation , but may feel comfortable completing the dt . for these women ,",
            "the dt in combination with astute , compassionate clinical assessments during oncology visits may provide the best opportunities to uncover clinically - significant psychological distress .",
            "key elements of quality care , including those providing psychological support services and compassionate care to individuals with cancer , are recognized as essential areas in need of improvement   .",

            "pearson correlations were used to assess the nature of the relationship between the instrumental and lst measures .",
            "the starch content of the sweet potato was roughly 81% and the ratio 147% amylose : 8693% amylopectin ratio .",
            "the glucose syrup produced from the spss was concentrated to 6373.9brix and was then isomerized at 60c for 5  h using glucose isomerase .",
            "prior to isomerization , the spss had a glucose content of 51% and < 1.0% fructose .",
            "the intention was to improve the fructose content by extension of the sweetness and storage stability of the spss through isomerization .",
            "after isomerization , although the fructose yield was slightly improved , the major sugar found in the spss was glucose ( 47.2  1.8% ) .",

            "it has been reported by crabb and shetty   that it is preferable to remove calcium ions prior to isomerization because they inhibit the isomerization of glucose into fructose .",
            "the possible inhibition of glucose isomerase by calcium ions may be due to the competition with the required magnesium ions for the enzyme 's active site .",
            "it has been reported by kasumi et al .   that the enzyme glucose isomerase depends on either magnesium or manganese ion for its activity to take place .",

            "the calcium content was roughly eight and 16 times more in the spss than that in the ginger and pancake syrups , respectively .",
            "the high calcium content of the spss could have been due to the typically high calcium content of sweet potatoes , although calcium content of different varieties of sweet potatoes could vary greatly .",

            "likewise , the mean potassium content of the spss was 268  8.5  mg/100  g ( table 1 ) , which was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher and several times more than that of the pancake and ginger syrups .",
            "overall , the results of this study demonstrated that the spss had higher mineral ( calcium , magnesium , phosphorus , iron , and potassium ) content when compared to the ginger and pancake syrups . in general ,",
            "as shear rate increased the apparent viscosity of the spss , pancake , and ginger syrups decreased , which resulted in the syrups exhibiting shear - thinning behavior as described by abu - jdayil et al . .",
            "these shear - thinning effects indicated that the spss and other syrups behaved as non - newtonian fluids . in shear - thinning fluids ,",
            "the shear - thinning behavior observed in the three syrup samples could be attributed to stress - induced breakdown of the network structure .",

            "the flow curves of the spss , pancake and ginger syrups are shown in figures 2(a)2(d ) .",
            "it can be seen in figure 2(a ) that , after a sharp reduction , the viscosity was stabilized at high shear rates .",
            "this result suggests that the onset of shear thinning occurs at a lower shear rate .",
            "it has been speculated that this could be due to the onset of entanglements caused by the presence of the highly branched , high molecular weight amylopectin .",
            "sweet potatoes contain high amounts of the branched - chain polymer amylopectin , with branch points occurring through -1 - 6 bonds .",
            "generally , amylopectins occur in most cereals and plants , contributing to about 80 to 85% of the total starch content . according to kelco ,",
            "high viscosity is desirable only under low shear rate conditions and should decrease as flow rate increases .",
            "spss , pancake , and ginger syrup had their highest viscosities under the lowest shear rates , and viscosity of the syrups decreased as flow increased .",
            "viscosity readings of the three syrups were observed at 65 seconds for each trial . on day 0",

            "the mean viscosity of the spss , pancake , and ginger syrup increased between days 0 and 30 and decreased between days 49 and 70 .",
            "strain is imposed on syrup when it is poured into bottles for storage and also when the syrup is poured unto waffles or pancakes by consumers ; therefore data from this study confirmed that the viscosity of spss , pancake , and ginger changed over time as strain was applied .",
            "typical shear rates versus shear stress responses of the spss , pancake , and ginger syrups at the constant temperature of 22c are shown in figures 3(a)3(d ) . as expected , shear stress increased with increasing rate in a fairly linear fashion .",
            "the mean apparent viscosity ranged from 0.03 to 0.50 , 0.01 to 14.2 , and 0.07 to 2.2  pas for spss , pancake , and ginger syrups , respectively , during storage . in general ,",
            "scarce information is available in the published literature regarding the rheology of sweet potato syrup .",
            "however , ngadi and yu   reported apparent viscosities ranging from 0.035 to 0.651  pas for different grades and temperatures of maple syrups .",
            "johnson   also reported the viscosity of maple syrup at 25c as 0.1635  pas .",
            "the viscosity for spss at 25c ( 0.03 to 0.5  pas ) in the current study was consistent with the range obtained for maple syrup . on days 0 , 30 , and 70 , ginger syrup had the highest viscosity while , on day 49 ,",
            "compared to the results for days 0 , 30 , and 70 , the pancake syrup displayed unusual elevations in viscosity on day 49 , even though extreme care was taken while conducting the experiment and measures were done in duplicate with the intent of minimizing errors .",
            "it is still possible that , despite the care taken , some type of experimental error influenced the result for the pancake syrup on day 49 .",
            "overall , the spss and pancake syrup were the thinner syrups with similar viscosities on days 0 and 70 . viscosity readings of the spss using lst were similar to the instrumental rheological data .",
            "as with the instrumental data , on day 0 , the viscosities of the three syrups were similar .",
            "pancake and ginger syrup had a significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher viscosity than spss on day 30 . on days 49 and 70 ,",
            "pancake and ginger syrups were similar to each other . at the beginning of the storage study there was a weak positive relationship ( r = 0.4 ) between the line spread and instrumental measures .",

            "each syrup sample showed an endothermic curve which indicates that the syrups absorbed energy during heating .",
            "water loss temperatures and melting endotherms of syrups are fairly broad because sugars do not have sharp water loss temperatures and their water loss proceeds over a temperature range .",

            "the increase in water loss temperature from days 49 to 70 for pancake and ginger syrups could be related to the fact that they had higher fructose contents than the spss .",

            "this finding is supported by a growing body of literature and suggests caution in the interpretation of anca positivity , a finding traditionally viewed as highly specific for aav if confirmed by both immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassay .",
            "this process is based , first , upon the confirmation of mpo or pr3 specificity through either elisa or chemiluminescent assays .",
            "the specificity of immunofluorescence for anca testing is suboptimal , as immunofluorescence assays are associated with positive results in a number of conditions other than small vessel vasculitides .",

            "once confirmation by enzyme immunoassay or chemiluminescence is obtained ; however , a positive anca result in and of itself is not diagnostic of aav but rather requires clinical - pathological correlation and histological confirmation .",
            "the case we describe here is emblematic in this sense because , based on the sole assumption that pulmonary pseudo - tumors are well - described manifestations of igg4-rd , the histological evidence of igg4-related dacryoadenitis appeared sufficient for diagnostic purposes and did not require confirmation with a lung biopsy . because cavitary lesions are not typical of igg4-rd , however , we proceeded to lung biopsy , which ultimately led to the concomitant diagnosis of aav",
            ". the fact of a paravertebral thoracic mass in our patient further complicated the differential diagnosis , as it is an atypical manifestation of either gpa or igg4-rd . in summary , the finding of a positive anca  even with a specificity for pr3should not lead to premature closure of the diagnostic evaluation , particularly if the pattern of organ involvement is not strictly typical of aav . in our patient ,",
            "as described in our aggregate analysis , this was actually the case of 3 patients with biopsy - proven igg4-rd and positive anca who developed clinical manifestations of aav shortly after the diagnosis .",
            "indeed , both mpo- and pr3-anca of patients with aav have been previously shown to induce respiratory burst , calcium flux , and degranulation of neutrophils , thus directly contributing to the pathophysiology of aav .",
            "igg4 anca are known to elicit the vigorous generation of reactive oxygen species in vitro , comparable to those elicited by igg3 anca , and greater than those induced by igg1 anca .",
            "the anca in aav are most often igg1 and igg4a finding that we confirmed in our patient .",
            "it is therefore tempting to speculate that the prominent igg1 and igg4 production that is characteristic of igg4-rd might foster the development of aav in some patients with an appropriate genetic background .",
            "indeed , the abundant igg4 positive plasma cell infiltrate that we found in gpa lesions may further support this hypothesis .",
            "igg4-rd in patients with positive anca was limited to the head and neck , and did not involve other commonly affected organs , such as the lung , the pancreas , the biliary tree , and the retroperitoneum .",
            "in contrast , aav in patients with established igg4-rd presented with systemic manifestations beyond the ear / nose / throat region , consistent with the notion of that anca positivity is more common in the former clinical setting than in the latter .",
            "these observations suggest that patients with igg4-rd and positive anca might be more at risk of developing a systemic form of aav",
            ". indeed , head and neck manifestations of igg4-rd are typically anca negative raising the possibility that anca in these patients might sustain an underlying vasculitic process rather than being primarily linked to igg4-rd",
            ". additional cases and a longer follow - up are needed in order to confirm this hypothesis .",
            "table 2 describes the clinical characteristics of 4 additional patients with positive anca and a diagnosis of possible igg4-rd with meningeal ( 3 cases ) and retroperitoneal ( 1 case ) involvement .",
            "anca specificity was confirmed by elisa in all 4 patients , but no diagnostic procedures were performed in these patients . for these reasons , despite serum igg4 increase , we did not include these cases in our aggregate analysis .",
            "however , as opposite to pachymeningeal involvement , which might occurs in up to 60% of patients with gpa , retroperitoneal fibrosis is an uncommon manifestation of aav .",
            "therefore , while those cases of anca positive pachymeningitis are more likely patients with gpa , anca positive retroperitoneal fibrosis with elevated serum igg4 could represent a case of igg4-rd .",

            "histological findings of the retroperitoneal tissue , however , have not been reported in these case series , thus making impossible to drive definitive conclusions .",
            "in conclusion , the present work demonstrates that anca positivity in patients with biopsy - proven igg4-rd should prompt the exclusion of a concomitant vasculitic process .",
            "in addition , a positive anca does not exclude the diagnosis of igg4-rd absolutely , particularly in cases with head and neck involvement that is characteristic of igg4-rd . the hypothesis that anca might predict the development of aav in patients with igg4-rd deserves larger case series with a longer follow - up .",

            "there was a significant decrease in the values of rbcs along with hb% and significant increase in wbcs and esr in the control group rats as compared to normal rats after 21 days of treatment which indicated that the second stage of inflammation had occurred in the body .",
            "however , the haematological parameters of the blood of rats treated with acetone extract ( 300  mg / kg and 500  mg / kg ) and the standard drug indomethacin showed a lower decrease in the red cells counts and hb% and also a lower increase in the wbc count and esr values ( table 7 ) . in comparison , it can be seen that the highest impact was seen in case of the standard group , while the lowest impact was seen in the lower dose of the acetone extract , even though significant and sustained impact was noticed in all the three groups as compared to the control group .",

            "the evolutionary process of the aldehyde oxidase gene cluster in mammals is characterised by a sudden and species - specific shift from multiplication to suppression / deletion .",
            "bos taurus ( cow ) seems to have maintained three active aldehyde oxidase genes ( aox1 , aox4 and aox3l1 ) on chromosome 2 .",
            "the absence of nucleotide sequences with similarity to aox3 strongly suggests that this gene has been deleted .",
            "deletion of the aox3 gene seems to be a conserved feature in another herbivore , the horse , although our present view of the aldehyde oxidase cluster in this animal species is still incomplete .",
            "the genome of dogs is characterised by two seemingly active aox4 and aox3l1 loci and two inactive aox1 and aox3 pseudogenes clustering on chromosome 37 .",
            "the vestiges of numerous exons with nucleotide similarity to the rodent aox1 and aox3 genes are easily identified on two separate regions slightly upstream of the dog aox4 and aox3l1 loci .",
            "it is interesting to notice that the dog is currently the only mammalian species that seems to be lacking aox1 , in addition to aox4 .",
            "this observation has important implications , as this mammal is devoid of aldehyde oxidase activity in the liver .",
            "humans are endowed with a single functional aldehyde oxidase gene , namely aox1 , consisting of the canonical 35 conserved coding exons .",
            "this is the result of the persistence of the aox3 deletion and the simultaneous transformation of aox4 and aox3l1 into inactive , albeit transcribed , pseudogenes . aox1 and the two pseudogenes map to a short segment on chromosome 2q .",
            "functional inactivation of the aox4 and aox3l1 genes occurred before the appearance of the human species , as chimpanzees ( pan troglodytes ) are endowed with the same complement of aldehyde oxidase genes and pseudogenes as humans .",
            "functional suppression of aox4 and aox3l1 seems to be the result of two recent , distinct and asynchronous events , based on the results obtained in the old - world monkeys ( macaca fascicularis and macaca mulatta ) . in fact",
            ", the genomes of these monkeys seem to contain two functional ( aox1 and aox3l1 ) as well as one or two inactive ( aox3 and aox4 ) pseudogenes clustering on chromosome 12 ( m. terao , unpublished result ) . in summary , two phylogenetically distinct branches of the evolutionary process led to the extant complement of worm / insect / plant and vertebrate aldehyde oxidases through an equivalent number of primitive and distinct gene duplication events involving the xor ancestor .",
            "these initial events were followed by a divergent series of species - specific and more recent gene multiplication events that occurred not only in vertebrates but also in plants , worms and insects .",
            "maize , tomato and arabidopsis thaliana are respectively characterised by two , three and four structurally very similar aldehyde oxidase genes .",
            "similarly , the flatworm , c. elegans , and the fruitfly , drosophila melanogaster , are endowed , respectively , with two and four aldehyde oxidases . the most ancient member of the vertebrate aldehyde oxidase family is aox1 .",
            ", the evolutionary order of appearance of aox3 , aox4 and aox3l1 is unknown ; however , a number of considerations led us to propose that aox4 is more ancient than aox3 , which , in turn , appeared earlier than aox3l1 .",
            "the data available on the tissue distribution of human aox1 are limited [ 23 - 25 ] .",
            "the richest source of the enzyme is the liver , however , where aox1 serves an important role in the metabolism of xenobiotics .",
            "aox1 is also present in the respiratory system , where it can be identified in the epithelial cells lining the trachea and bronchi , as well as in the alveolar cells of the lung . in the digestive system ,",
            "the kidney is another source of aox1 , with synthesis of the protein occurring in the proximal distal and collecting tubules . finally , the prostate and adrenal glands seem to contain detectable amounts of the protein .",
            "the localisation of aox1 in the central nervous system is largely unknown , although it was reported that the corresponding transcript is expressed in the glial component of the anterior horns of the spinal cord . in general , the tissue distributions of aox1 in humans and baboons , the only other primate for which studies are available , are concordant , particularly in relation to the presence of the enzyme in the livers and the respiratory systems .",
            "two mouse aldehyde oxidases ( aox1 and aox3 ) have an overlapping tissue distribution , which is largely superimposable with that of human aox1 .",
            "while this is expected in the case of aox1 , given its orthologous relationship with the human enzyme , the observation is important in the case of aox3 . by far",
            "the richest source of the two enzymes is the liver , where aox1 and aox3 are present exclusively in the cytosolic fraction of the hepatocyte compartment .",
            "different mouse strains are characterised by different relative amounts of the two hepatic enzymes , however .",
            "high levels of aox3 and much lower levels of aox1 are present in the outbred cd1 and the inbred c57bl/6j strains . by contrast , the two inbred strains dba/2 and cba have an almost complete deficit of expression of aox3 .",
            "this deficit is the result of epigenetic silencing of the corresponding gene by methylation of the regulatory sequences .",
            "significant expression of both aox1 and aox3 is observed also in the lung , which is the second richest source .",
            "limited amounts of aox1 and aox3 are also believed to be present in the central nervous system , on the basis of in situ hybridisation experiments http://www.brainatlas.org / aba/. expression is limited to the choroid plexus , which is the organ devoted to the production and re - absorption of the cephalorachidian fluid , and the motor neuronal cell population in the brain and spinal cord . while cellular co - localisation of aox3 in the choroid plexus is clear , similar evidence is not available for the motor neurones .",
            "low levels of aox1 and/or aox3 are also inferred from the expression data available in the online mendelian inheritance in man ( omim ) section of the ncbi website http://http./www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. of particular interest is the presence of aox1 in the skin ( which was recently confirmed ) , the mammary gland and the genitourinary tract .",
            "the richest source of aox4 is the harderian gland , a prominent intra - orbital exocrine gland involved in diverse homeostatic functions , such as thermoregulation , lubrication of the eye surface , control of pheromonal cues and regulation of the circadian rhythm [ 30 - 32 ] .",
            "the gland is present in various vertebrate species , but is absent in humans and primates .",
            "far lower amounts of aox4 have also been identified in the epidermal layer of the skin and the keratinised epithelia lining the oral cavity , oesophagus and proximal portion of the stomach . in the skin ,",
            "the epidermis is not the only structure containing aox4 , as sebaceous glands are also enriched in the corresponding mrna .",
            "interestingly , sebaceous and harderian glands share common characteristics , producing a lipid - rich secretion , which is involved in thermoregulation and pheromone release . finally , aox3l1 is unique , being limited to the secretory cells of the bowman 's gland , the most important exocrine gland of the olfactory mucosa .",
            "these structures are present in all vertebrates , including humans , with the exception of fish .",
            "the serous / mucous product of bowman 's glands is important in shaping the microenvironment necessary for a proper stimulation of the nasal neuroepithelium by odorants .",
            "bowman 's glands are so rich in aox3l1 that they were used as the source for the purification of the enzyme to homogeneity .",
            "most of the literature on aldehyde oxidases has focused on this aspect of their biology [ 33 - 38 ] .",
            "all the members of the family are characterised by broad substrate specificity , oxidising numerous types of molecule . in spite of their name ,",
            "aldehyde oxidases catalyse not only the oxidation of aldehydes into the corresponding carboxylic acid , but they also hydroxylate n - heterocyclic molecules with high efficiency . human aox1 and rodent aox1/aox3 may actually represent the major cytosolic enzymes metabolising xenobiotics in the liver .",
            "the enzymes are involved in the phase i metabolism of numerous compounds of both medical and toxicological relevance , potentially acting in concert with the microsomal cytochrome p450 system [ 33 - 39 ] .",
            "extensive discussion of the compounds metabolised by human or rodent aldehyde oxidases is beyond the scope of this paper , and the reader is referred to specific reviews for more details .",
            "it is worth mentioning that aldehyde oxidases have an important role in the metabolism of the anti - tumour and immunosuppressive agents , methotrexate , 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine , and aldophosphamide , the active metabolite of cyclophosphamide .",
            "aldehyde oxidases have also been reported to metabolise the antimalarial agent , quinine   and the anti - viral drug famcyclovir .",
            "finally , human aox1 is known to cause the inactivation of the hypnotic , zaleplon . as evident from this short and incomplete list ,",
            "the drug metabolising activity of aldehyde oxidases is predominantly related to the ability of these enzymes to hydroxylate n - heterocyclic rings . from a toxicological perspective",
            ", the aldehyde oxidase activity present in mammalian liver has been reported to play a major role in the oxidation of environmental pollutants such as phthalazines .",
            "by contrast , it is unlikely that mouse aox1 and aox3 are of any relevance for the oxidation of the ethanol metabolite , acetaldehyde , into acetic acid .",
            "although a wealth of data are available on exogenous substrates , endogenous substrates of aldehyde oxidases are still being sought .",
            "the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg , http://www.kegg.jp ) contains a number of metabolic pathways listing potential physiological substrates of aldehyde oxidases , such as the serotonin metabolite , 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde ( pathway : ko00380 ) , and the amino acid catabolites ( s)-methylmalonate semi - aldehyde ( pathway : ko00280 ) and gentisate aldehyde ( pathway : ko00350 ) . at present",
            ", however , there is no direct evidence of the significance of human aox1 or any of the other mammalian homologues in the oxidation of these substrates .",
            "aldehyde oxidases are also purported to play a role in the metabolism of vitamins b3 ( nicotinamide ) , b6 ( pyridoxal phosphate ) and a ( retinol ) .",
            "the vitamin b3 metabolite , n1-methylnicotinamide is a good substrate for semi - purified human and monkey aox1 preparations .",
            "pyridoxal , the vitamin b6 precursor , is oxidised to 4-pyridoxic acid by the human enzyme   and by the two mouse liver aldehyde oxidases , aox1 and aox3 ( terao m. , unpublished results ) .",
            "pyridoxal is currently the sole example of a substrate that shows a certain degree of selectivity for a specific aldehyde oxidase protein as it is not recognised by purified mouse aox4 .",
            "vitamin a metabolism is probably the endogenous pathway for which more stringent information on the involvement of aldehyde oxidases is available .",
            "the ability of mammalian aldehyde oxidases to catalyse the oxidation of retinaldehyde ( a physiological precursor ) into retinoic acid ( the active metabolite of vitamin a ) was discovered in rabbit liver cytosol   and confirmed using purified preparations of mouse liver aox1 . in our hands",
            ", retinaldehyde has been one of the best substrates not only of mouse aox1 , but also of aox3 , aox4 and aox3l1 .",
            "the km and vmax measured for the purified forms of aox1 , aox3 and aox4 compare well   with the same parameters reported for the three aldehyde dehydrogenases , aldh1a1 , aldh1a2 and aldh1a3 , which have long been known to catalyse the oxidation of retinaldehyde and to play a critical role in the morphogenetic activity of retinoic acid during the development of the vertebrate embryo .",
            "support for the relevance of aox4 for the local synthesis and accumulation of retinoic acid in the harderian gland has recently been provided by the phenotypic , genetic and biochemical characterisation of the first aldehyde oxidase knockout mouse to be generated .",
            "although a substantial amount of information on the structure and evolution of mammalian aldehyde oxidases is available , little is known about the physiological function of these enzymes in mammals , with particular reference to humans and relevant animal models .",
            "progress in establishing the significance of this class of enzymes for the homeostasis of the mammalian organism is clearly a priority . to this end",
            ", it will be necessary to identify the endogenous substrate(s ) of human aox1 and all the other mammalian isoenzymes .",
            "this is likely to require an integrated approach based on the definition of the substrate(s ) using purified enzyme preparations , and validation of the results in vivo .",
            "it is envisaged that in vivo studies in humans will require the measurement of relevant molecules in biological fluids , using cohorts of individuals genotyped for the presence of aox1 allelic variants with alterations in the catalytic activity of the corresponding protein products .",
            "it will therefore be important to increase the number of population studies   designed to discover new aox1 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) ( see , for instance , our reference rs41309768 , in the single nucleotide polymorphism database [ dbsnp ] section of the ncbi database ) .",
            "similar studies will also have to be performed in experimental animals , with the caveat that mice and rats are characterised by the presence of multiple aldehyde oxidase forms , as discussed above . in this context",
            ", strains of mice characterised by a different profile of aldehyde oxidases , as well as specific knockout animals , will represent useful tools to this end .",
            "uplc / q - tof - ms / ms , followed by chemometrics and analysis of principle components , would very likely identify one or more metabolic pathways that are perturbed in the absence of each one of the mouse aox enzymes .",
            "association studies aimed at defining the relevance of aox1 for the aetio - pathogenesis and progression of specific human diseases are also needed , as they may provide insights into the functional significance of the enzyme .",
            "these studies will integrate the knowledge that is likely to be generated from the phenotypic analysis of the genetically engineered mice that are already available or will be available in the near future . along these lines , our studies on the aox4 knockout mouse have already provided evidence that the corresponding protein is involved in the control of skin homeostasis and in the postnatal development of the harderian gland . whether the two phenomena are linked to a decrease in the local metabolism of retinaldehyde to retinoic",
            "further knowledge is likely to be gained soon by phenotypic analysis of the newly generated aox3l1 knockout animal ( m. terao , unpublished results ) .",
            "nevertheless , the data already gathered strongly suggest that the various aldehyde oxidases are unlikely to play a vital function in the homeostasis of the mouse , as both types of knockout animal develop normally and are fertile .",
            "three final considerations are worth making . the first two concern , again , the basic problem of the physiological significance of aldehyde oxidases .",
            "in this regard , a key point relates to the reason(s ) why the evolution of vertebrate organisms is associated with a first wave of multiplication and a subsequent phase of deletion / suppression of the aldehyde oxidase genes .",
            "these phenomena are likely to be related to the necessity for developing specific and possibly tissue - related functions in certain animal species , which must have become dispensable in humans and primates .",
            "the idea is readily acceptable for an enzyme like aox4 , which is highly enriched in the harderian gland , as the structure is absent in humans and primates .",
            "it may be also viable in the case of aox3l1 , if the protein serves a function in the recognition of odorants .",
            "indeed , it is well known that olfaction is much more developed and sophisticated in rodents than in humans .",
            "the presence of an extra enzyme ( aox3 ) in the liver of the mouse , relative to the human , is more complicated to explain .",
            "nevertheless , in generating hypotheses as to the real function of the various aldehyde oxidases , an open mind should be always kept , since the function of these proteins may not necessarily be related to their enzymatic activity .",
            "the third consideration is of a more practical nature and is relevant for the role exerted by aldehyde oxidases in drug metabolism . with respect to this ,",
            "it is clear from what has been reported here that caution should be exercised in using rodents , dogs and possibly rhesus monkeys as good proxies for the human situation .",

            "this hemoglobin is a derivate of adult hemoglobin ( hba ) , with monosaccharide ( fructose or glucose ) attachments . in strict chemical terms ,",
            "the molecular structure of hba1c is n-(1-deoxy)-fructosyl - hemoglobin or n-(1-deoxyfroctose-1-yl ) hemoglobin beta chain .",
            "methods routinely used for the measurement of glycated hb percentage separate the molecule on the basis of its charge , structure , or antigenic properties .",
            "the most popular methods rely on the increased negative charge found in the glycated hb molecule to distinguish it from its nonglycated form .",
            "these assays include electrophoresis and ion - exchange chromatography as by high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) .",
            "alternatively , boronate affinity chromatography separates glycated hb on the basis of its structure rather than its charge . in this assay",
            ", separation is the result of carbohydrate moieties on the glycated hb molecule binding by condensation to the affinity reagent , di - hydroxyboronate .",
            "this method is specific for all glycated hbs , irrespective of molecular charge or the site of glycation on the hb molecule .",
            "in addition , it is also able to detect the glycated portion of hb in patients with hb variants such as hb s , c , or f. thus , the term total glycated hb has been used to describe this type of assay .",
            "finally , immunoassays , such as the method we have utilized in this study , have been developed for the measurement of hba1c .",
            "monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies generated against the 6- to 8-amino acid peptide of the glycated amino terminus of the -globin chain are here utilized .",
            "advantages to measure hba1c percentage with this technology involve the simplicity of the approach ; the need for one small ( only few microliters ) blood sample ; the fact that the assay is relatively unaffected by recent food intake , activity , illness , or stress ; it still reflects glycemic control during the preceding few weeks   allowing measurement of hba1c even when pathological hemoglobin variants or nhp hemoglobins are involved .",
            "unfortunately , there are also a lot of different variables associated with measurement of glycated hb percentage that could potentially modify those values ; for example , processes that decrease the mean lifespan of rbcs will reduce the availability of hb for glycation and , therefore , the percentage of glycated hb , irrespective of glucose concentrations .",
            "similarly , conditions that increase the lifespan of rbcs ( e.g. , iron deficiency ) will increase the amount of glycated hb .",

            "percentages of hba1 and hba1c in nondiabetic baboons ( papio anubis ) , measured by use of cation - exchange chromatography , are approximately half of those found in humans .",
            "it has been suggested that this may be explained on the basis of differences in the life - span of rbcs in humans ( 100 to 120 days ) compared to baboons ( 30 to 60 days ) .",

            "indeed , the same authors postulated that women with a high level of ta had a greater likelihood of becoming pregnant than those with non - detectable or low levels of ta ( 24 ) .",
            "along the same lines , the lack of ta in gcs is associated with occult ovarian insufficiency ( 25 ) .",
            "finally , in gcs obtained from the same individuals , it was shown that ta predicts ivf treatment outcomes better than tl ( 26 ) .",
            "importantly , tl in human eggs was found to predict cytoplasmic fragmentation in embryos suggesting that telomere shortening induces apoptosis in human prei - mplantation embryos , well in accordance with a telomere theory of reproductive senescence in women ( 27 ) .",
            "this data collectively suggest ta / tl of luteinized gcs is positively correlated with clinical pregnancy rate and , indicate that ta of ovarian luteinized gcs could help health workers to predict the clinical outcomes of ivf treatment .",
            "during normal pregnancies , a decrease in ta activity when comparing the early gestation period ( < 10 weeks ) , with the late gestation period ( > 10 weeks ) , is observed ( 28 ) .",
            "thus , placenta and chorionic villi specimens from the first trimester of gestation exhibit significantly more ta than placenta and chorionic villi specimens from the second and third trimester during gestation ( 29,30 ) .",
            "specifically , a high ta was identified in trophoblast cell fractions of the chorion , suggesting that this fraction is a major source of ta activity ( 31 ) .",
            "additionally , the expression of htert was observed in chorions from early stages of gestation , but not in the placenta at the late stages of gestation , with a close correlation between ta and htert expression ( 31 ) .",
            "iugr is a common pregnancy complication , which can be defined as the failure of the fetus to reach the size for which it is genetically programmed .",
            "delayed growth puts the fetus at risk during pregnancy and is associated with adverse outcomes during delivery and to neonate health problems .",
            "these may include a low birth weight , difficulty in handling the stress of vaginal delivery , decreased oxygen levels , hypoglycemia , low resistance to infection , low apgar scores ( a test given immediately after birth to evaluate the newborn 's physical condition and determine the need for special medical care ) , breathing problems associated with meconium aspiration ( inhalation of stools passed while in the uterus ) , difficulties in maintaining body temperature , an abnormally high red blood cell count , long - term growth problems , and in the most severe cases , iugr can lead to still birth ( 33 ) .",
            "interestingly , only weak ta was detected in the placenta and chorionic villi specimens from women with pregnancies complicated by iugr ( 34,35 ) .",
            "indeed , htert mrna expression was detected in the placenta and chorionic villi specimens during the first , second and third trimester of gestation in normal pregnancies , whereas copy numbers of htert were significantly lower in placenta specimens from women with pregnancies complicated by iugr ( 21 ) .",
            "the expression of hterc was observed in chorions obtained during early and late gestation and was not linked to ta ( 31 ) . on the other hand ( 36 )",
            ", an analysis of the terc telomerase subunit gene copy number in placentas from pregnancies complicated by iugr revealed that the terc gene copy number was decreased in trophoblasts in placentas from women with pregnancies complicated by iugr , and it was thus suggested that this may promote senescence in trophoblasts in placentas from pregnancies complicated by iugr . in accordance with these data , a decreased tl was observed in placenta samples collected from women with pregnancies complicated by iugr ( 37 ) .",
            "furthermore , a decreased ta in placentas from women with pregnancies complicated by iugr was associated with increased apoptosis ( 34 ) .",
            "twins affected by growth discordance exhibit significant differences in their growth rate and size even though they develop in the same intrauterine environment ( 38 ) .",
            "importantly , birth weight discordance amongst twins is closely correlated to perinatal morbidity and mortality ( 39 ) .",
            "thus , specimens from placental tissues from twins affected by growth discordance ( > 20% weight difference ) or not ( < 20% weight difference ) were collected after birth , and ta was analyzed ( 40 ) .",
            "the results revealed that in the growth discordant group , ta was significantly higher in the larger twin than in the smaller twin ( 40 ) .",
            "oxygen is a necessity for life ; yet , it is toxic to cells when dysregulated .",
            "thus , both high and low levels of oxygen are deleterious to developing embryos . in normal pregnancies , in early gestation , the fetus and placenta exist in a relatively hypoxic environment with an ambient po2 < 20 mm hg ( 41 ) .",
            "the low oxygen tension favors cell proliferation and angiogenesis in the placenta , whereas it simultaneously supports vasculogenesis , hematopoiesis and chondrogenesis of the developing fetus ( 42,43 ) . upon establishing intervillous circulation at approximately 1012 weeks of gestation ,",
            "oxygen tension rises to 4080 mmhg and remains in this range throughout the second and third trimesters . in order to support normal placental function and fetal development",
            ", the placenta adapts to the alterations in oxygen levels by the modulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 ( hif-1 ) expression and by increasing cellular antioxidant defenses ( 44 ) .",
            "thus , restricted oxygen availability is normal and necessary in utero ; however , excessive fetal hypoxia leads to adverse outcomes , including fetal death , iugr and low birth weight ( 45 ) .",
            "indeed , intrauterine hypoxia may be due to a variety of causes , including prolapse or occlusion of the umbilical cord , placental infarction , hypertension , anemia , pulmonary disease , preeclampsia , as well as maternal smoking ( 46 ) .",
            "importantly , intrauterine hypoxia can cause cellular damage within the central nervous system and is associated with a reduced total brain volume and altered cortical volume and structure , a decrease in the total number of cells and myelination deficits ( 47 ) .",
            "this results in an increased mortality rate , including an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome ( sids ) .",
            "moreover , oxygen deprivation in the fetus and neonate have been implicated as either a primary or as a contributing risk factor in numerous neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) , eating disorders and cerebral palsy , as well as in the later development of neurodegenerative diseases ( 48 ) .",
            "hif-1 is a transcription factor of major importance in the cellular response to oxygen deficiency with specific roles during embryogenesis ( 49 ) .",
            "hif-1 is a heterodimeric complex composed of the two basic helix - loop - helix pas domain ( bhlh - pas ) subunits hif-1 and hif-1 ( 50 ) .",
            "the hif-1 gene is constitutively transcribed under hypoxic conditions and determines hif-1 biological activity ( 51 ) , whereas the hif-1 subunit dimerizes with several different bhlh - pas proteins and is continuously expressed ( 50 ) .",
            "hif-1 targets genes that encode proteins which regulate oxygen homeostasis and are critical for developmental and physiological processes in hypoxic environments ( 51 ) .",
            "indeed , hif-1 activity is critical for normal fetal development , as it has been shown that murine embryos lacking functional hif-1 die on / or before e10.5 ( 52 ) .",
            "an important issue to resolve is the existence of a correlation between hif-1 and ta .",
            "indeed , hif-1 expression was detectable , as demonstrated by western blot analysis , in first trimester placenta samples , but not in placental samples from the second and third trimester ( 53,54 ) .",
            "accordingly , htert protein expression was increased in placental tissues before 10 weeks than in placental tissues after 10 weeks of gestation ( 54 ) . in vitro studies",
            "thus , tl distribution in huvecs under hypoxic conditions seems to be regulated by a balance between telomere attrition by hypoxia and telomere elongation by enhanced ta acting on telomeres ( 55 ) .",
            "indeed , coussens et al ( 56 ) demonstrated that hif-1 affects telomerase regulation in murine embryological stem cells and these authors suggested that hif-1a may have a physiologically relevant role in the maintenance of functional levels of telomerase in stem cells ( 56 ) .",
            "furthermore , it was demonstrated that the htert promoter region contains two hif-1 consensus motifs , which are essential for htert transactivation by hif-1 .",
            "the introduction of an antisense oligonucleotide for hif-1 diminishes htert expression during hypoxia , indicating that the upregulation of htert under hypoxic conditions is directly mediated through hif-1 ( 54 ) .",
            "thus , nishi et al ( 54 ) suggested that the regulation of htert promoter activity by hif-1 represents a mechanism for trophoblast growth during hypoxia according to the previous data ; there are two possibilities about the association between hypoxia induction and ta .",
            "dna damage in the telomere region can be induced by hypoxia , which would result in hif-1-induced telomerase expression in order to heal the damaged chromosome ends ; or an anti - apoptotic response may be triggered by the hypoxic induction of telomerase ( 5658 ) .",
            "a rapidly growing body of empirical evidence suggests that a major burden of disease can be traced back to the intrauterine period of life .",
            "importantly the sensitive biological functions of fetal cell proliferation , differentiation and maturation respond to , or are affected by conditions in the internal or external environment .",
            "the result of these responses are structural and/or functional changes in cells , tissues and organ systems that have important long - term consequences for subsequent health and disease susceptibility ( 59 ) .",
            "exposure to psychosocial stress and/or biological stress mediators during gestation has been identified as a condition that may modulate the long - term programming effects of the intrauterine environment ( 60 ) .",
            "indeed , exposure to psychosocial stress during gestation appears to be an important risk factor for the earlier onset of complex , common age - related diseases ( 60 ) .",
            "studies on humans have demonstrated links between chronic or excessive psychosocial stress exposure and telomere biology ( 5,61,62 ) .",
            "these data suggest that stress - related changes in telomere integrity may be a possible mechanism linking psychosocial stress and age - related disease ( 63 ) .",
            "indeed , accelerated telomere shortening reflects stress - related oxidative damage to cells and increased aging ( 64 ) .",
            "substantial evidence supports the hypothesis that depression creates abnormalities in stress - related biological outcomes .",
            "thus , individuals with mood disorders have a significantly shorter tl compared with stable individuals , representing as much as 10 years of accelerated aging ( 64 ) .",
            "furthermore , it has been demonstrated that exposure to a major stress hormone , such as cortisol , is associated with the downregulation of ta in activated human t lymphocytes ( 65 ) .",
            "this is highly relevant , as leukocyte tl is a predictor of age - related disease onset and mortality ( 66 ) .",
            "there is also the question of whether cellular aging is related to patterns of allostasis ( 66 ) .",
            "telomeric dna quantity , dna damage and heat shock protein gene expression have been used as physiological stress markers in chickens ( 67 ) .",
            "exposure to maternal psychological stress during intrauterine life appears to induce not only adverse birth and neonatal outcomes , but also subsequent health and disease risk - related outcomes over the lifespan of an individual .",
            "the relevant outcomes include metabolic , endocrine , immune and cognitive processes ( 5 ) .",
            "one important question that has yet to be addressed is whether exposure to stress during intrauterine development can produce variations in tl , thereby potentially setting up a long - term trajectory at birth that defines or contributes to individual susceptibility for complex and common age - related diseases .",
            "entringer et al ( 59 ) examined the tl in leukocytes of individuals whose mothers had experienced a high level of psychological stress during pregnancy .",
            "these authors demonstrated that exposure to maternal psychosocial stress during intrauterine life was associated with a significantly shorter tl in young adulthood ( 59 ) .",
            "additionally , it has been suggested that maternal psychological stress during pregnancy may exert a ' programming ' effect on the developing telomere biology system that is already apparent at birth , as reflected by the setting of newborn tl ( 5 ) .",
            "the association between ta and maternal stress exposure during pregnancy , has not yet been investigated and may shed further light on telomere biology . indeed , it was postulated by shalev et al ( 5 ) that a ' better understanding of the mechanisms that govern and regulate telomere biology throughout the lifespan may inform our understanding of etiology and the long - term consequences of stress and mental illnesses on aging processes in diverse populations and settings ' .",

            "importantly , malnutrition in female rats has been shown to increase the production of the superoxide free radical ( o2 ) ( 73 ) .",
            "it is well established that oxidative damage is a major feature of the aging process and can lead to telomere shortening ( 74 ) , which is associated with cellular senescence in vitro and in vivo ( 75,76 ) .",
            "these data lead to the conclusion that increased cell apoptosis in the offspring can be caused by maternal protein restriction ( 75 ) .",

        "golden_summary": "telomeres are specific dna regions positioned at the ends of chromosomes and composed of functional non - coding repeats . upon cell division , the telomeres decrease in length by a preordained amount . when the telomeres become critically short , cells lose the ability to divide and enter a specific functioning mode designated as ' cellular senescence ' . however , human tissues express an enzyme that deters the shrinking of the telomeres , the telomerase . due to its ability to maintain telomere length , the telomerase slows down and possibly suspends the aging of the cells . in regard to this , solid evidence demonstrates that female human fertility decreases with increased maternal age and that various adverse factors , including alterations in telomerase activity , can contribute to age - associated infertility in women . the fact that telomerase activity is regulated in a time- and location - dependent manner in both embryo and placental tissues , highlights it potential importance to the successful completion of pregnancy . since maternal age is a crucial determining factor for the success of in vitro and in vivo fertilization , numerous studies have focused on telomerase activity and its correlation with mammalian fertilization , as well as the following cleavage and pre - implantation developmental processes . associations between telomerase activity and pregnancy complications have been previously observed . our aim in this review was to summarize and critically discuss evidence correlating telomerase activity with pregnancy complications ."

            "the inventory of devices required for evas is less compared with that for conventional endografts , as the only sizing variation in the nellix system is related to stent length .",
            "preoperative sizing is therefore straightforward , involving the selection of only a suitable length of device , which may be of benefit in an emergency setting .",
            "the avoidance of contralateral limb cannulation in evas may reduce the overall procedure duration in certain cases .",
            "the nellix system also provides an option for early hemostasis through endobag inflation with saline , while maintaining limb perfusion .",
            "a final advantage is the avoidance of type ii endo - leaks with aneurysm sac sealing .",
            "the potential disadvantages of the evas technique for ruptured aneurysm repair include a risk of enlarging a rupture or tearing the aorta with the pressure used to fill the endobags .",

            "fluvastatin transport in the human body is more complex than that of other statins because of its relatively high lipophilicity , which allows , at least partly , passive diffusion via the hepatocyte plasma membrane and increased absorption in the gut by transcellular passive diffusion .",
            "in addition , numerous studies claimed that fluvastatin is not transported by the p - glycoprotein drug transporter   , unlike some other statins , but it rather seems to be a substrate for organic anion transporters oatp1b1 , oatp1b3 , and oatp2b1 , which are rich in snps .",
            "some of these , especially oatp2b1 , have been reported to play an important role in statin uptake into hepatocytes and were implicated in modulating the pharmacological action and efficacy of fluvastatin .",

            "inspection of the data and manual analysis of the rhi showed that the maximal hyperemic response does not always occur in the same time period after occlusion ( data not shown ) , an observation that is supported by literature .",
            "for example , the time course of fmd is strongly influenced by age : comparison of young and older subjects indicates that the time frame to reach maximal vasodilatation after occlusion is significantly prolonged in older subjects .",
            "this may be remedied by refinement of the endopat software to allow for interindividual differences in hyperemic time course .",
            "although inter - individual differences in hyperemic time course is a potentially confounding factor when using the automatic analysis , manual analysis of our data did not result in significantly different findings ( data not shown ) .",
            "there are some indications that endothelial function is subject to a circadian rhythm , with a lower reactive hyperemic response in the morning , but this is not unambiguously supported   .",
            "in fact , the presumed circadian variability is probably more related to changes in physical activity , blood pressure and shear stress , and changes in plasma lipids .",
            "whatever the explanation may be , our experiments were performed within a short fixed time frame of maximally 2 hours , in a fasted condition and in complete rest , thereby reducing the influence of these confounding factors . as a consequence ,",
            "it is unlikely that circadian variability has influenced our measurement outcomes . finally , it is possible that previous experiments using ultrasound or plethysmography to assess the acute effect of an intervention on endothelial function are flawed because measurements were performed ( in the majority of the cases ) in the vasculature of one arm only , and thus relatively uncontrolled for concomitant systemic hemodynamic changes .",
            "we are well aware that the group sizes of our intervention experiments were small and that no formal control groups were included .",
            "however , the experiments were sufficiently powered to detect intervention - induced changes in endothelial function at effect sizes that are reported in literature using fmd or forearm blood flow plethysmography . in conclusion , whereas the reactive hyperemia index ( a measure for endothelial function ) , as determined by the endopat , is rather stable over time , the augmentation index ( a measure for arterial stiffness ) showed substantial intra - individual variability , limiting its value for evaluation of ( pharmacological ) interventions .",

            "glurs comprise three families of ionotropic receptors : ampa ( -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ) , nmda ( n - methyl - d - aspartate ) and kainate ; as well as three groups of metabotropic receptors ( mglurs i - iii ) .",
            "ionotropic receptors are found as tetramers of various subunits : 4 gria genes code for ampa subunits , 7 grin genes code for nmda subunits and 5 grik genes code for kainate subunits",
            ". finally , metabotropic receptors , which are g - protein coupled receptors , are coded by 8 grm genes .",
            "functionally , ionotropic glurs are specialized on different aspects of synaptic transmission . while nmda receptors act as coincident detectors of postsynaptic membrane depolarization and glutamate release , ampa receptors mediate fast transmission in excitatory synapses .",

            "linkage and association studies of natural variation , such as snps or microsatellites , have not been included in this work as these have a less direct implication in disease .",
            "of all four genes coding for ampa receptor subunits , only mutations in gria2 and gria3 have been related with pndds ( table 1 ) .",
            "alterations in these two genes have been associated with some cases of asd , but have mainly been found concomitant with i d .",
            "although chromosomal deletions encompassing gria2 had been described for individuals with mental and developmental retardation ( see ref . \n",
            "12 \n for review ) , only recent studies have identified specific mutations in gria2 in the context of i d , suggesting that gria2 haploinsufficiency might cause i d .",

            "interestingly , both duplications and deletions of gria3 , translate into a diminished or absent synthesis of glua3 protein .",

            "in fact , synaptic targeting and function of these receptors are not significantly altered in glua3 ko mice . remarkably , long - term potentiation ( ltp ) , widely thought to be the cellular basis of learning processes , is abnormal in these animals . nevertheless , in humans , the lack of glua3 could impair normal neuronal wiring or stabilization of activated synapses during development .",

            "interestingly , a complex loss - of - function mutation in grik2 was found to co - segregate with nsid .",
            "this grik2 mutation involves various deletions and inversions spanning exons 7 to 11 , resulting in loss of the first ligand - binding domain , the adjacent transmembrane domain , and the putative pore loop of gluk2 .",
            "this study strongly indicates that loss of gluk2 protein can cause severe - to - moderate cognitive impairment in humans .",
            "a grik4 variant with an insertion - deletion in the 3utr region ( which results in increased gluk4 levels ) was found to confer protection against bipolar disorder . moreover , this grik4 variant increased hippocampal activation during face processing , suggesting a link between kainate receptor - mediated excitation in the hippocampus and bipolar disorder .",
            "so far , the subfamily of kainate glutamate receptors is the one for which less mutations have been identified in the context of pndds .",
            "however , collectively taken , these results support the notion that mutations leading to up- or down - regulation of kainate subunits can cause learning disabilities and modulate mood disorders .",
            "currently , a limited number of papers report deleterious mutations related to pndds in grms ( see table 1 ) . of these ,",

            "the small number of mutations identified for grms make it still difficult to conjecture on their relevance to disease .",
            "nevertheless , a striking observation can be made : there is no report implicating grm mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders such as i d or asd . despite the extensive literature on the role of these receptors , especially grm1 and grm5 , in fragile x - syndrome and asd , deleterious mutations on grms",
            "have so far been found only in the context of psychiatric disorders , such as scz , bp or adhd .",
            "recently developed dna analysis tools are allowing for the rapid uncovering of glurs mutations in the context of pndds .",
            "this can be seen by the exponential increase in the number of papers reporting glur mutations in most recent years .",
            "based on this , we expect that new glur mutations will be identified in the future , hopefully allowing for a better understanding of glur etiological contribution to pndds .",
            "although the number of studies reporting glur mutations in pndd is so far restricted , some initial conclusions can be drawn .",
            "these will need to be examined in the light of future studies . in the first place ,",
            "mutations of subunits of some receptor subtypes are related to certain disease types but not to others . in this",
            "regard , mutations in ampa subunits have only been found in the context of i d and asd , both neurodevelopmental disorders .",
            "similarly , mutations in genes coding for ampar auxiliary proteins are also related with i d .",
            "along these lines , mutations in nmda subunits are mostly linked to i d and asd . in stark contrast , mutations in metabotropic receptors are only related to psychiatric disorders .",
            "accordingly , the data available would suggest that mutations in ionotropic glutamate receptors predispose towards neurodevelopmental disorders , while mutations in metabotropic receptors would predispose towards psychiatric disorders .",
            "one can also draw a parallel between the extent of mental disability and the contribution to neurotransmission of the affected receptor type .",
            "thus , loss - of - function mutations in ampa and nmda subunits are frequently found in patients with i d .",
            "this is consistent with their important role in neuronal development , fast transmission , and synaptic plasticity . on the other hand ,",
            "the abundance of grm mutations in individuals with psychiatric disorders is consistent with the more modulatory role of mglurs .",
            "the occurrence of i d in carriers of a mutant gluk2 suggests that tuning of neuronal network activity by kainate receptors can have profound effects on cognitive abilities .",
            "while some genes accumulate many potentially deleterious mutations , no mutations have been found in others . amongst ampa subunits , for instance , gria1 and gria4",
            "have not been found mutated in the context of pndd , while twelve different mutations have been described for gria3 .",
            "remarkably , the spectrum of mutations in nmda subunits concentrates in particular coding regions , namely , the extracellular and pore - forming domains .",
            "this observation suggests that impaired ion selectivity and conductance of nmda receptors is closely linked to developmental defects , while the role of its intracellular tail might have a less critical role in disease .",
            "there are several potential explanations why some glur genes do not appear mutated in relation to disease ; they might play indispensable biological functions , thus leading to lethality even in heterozygosity , or other molecules could compensate for their dysfunction .",
            "interestingly , we do not see an increased number of mutations in glur subunits expressed early in development , which a priori , should be more relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders .",
            "for instance , a similar number of mutations has been found for grin2b , which starts to be expressed early in development , and for grin2a , that is expressed post - natally .",
            "in contrast , no mutations have been described for gria4 , also highly expressed during development .",
            "nevertheless , this observation should be taken cautiously as mutations in developmental genes could cause lethality and also because gene expression data , mostly obtained from rodent species , might not be completely valid for humans .",
            "although the etiopathology of pndds is complex and multigenic , a growing set of genetic and functional evidences indicate the contribution of glutamate receptors in these damaging disorders .",

        "golden_summary": "objective : presence of genomic diversity among helicobacter pylori ( h. pylori ) strains have been suggested by numerous investigators . little is known about diversity of h. pylori strains isolated from iranian children and their association with virulence of the strains . our purpose was to assess the degree of genomic diversity among h. pylori strains isolated from iranian - children , on the basis of vaca genotype , caga status of the strains , sex , age as well as the pathological status of the patients.methods:genomic dna from 44 unrelated h. pylori strains isolated during 19972009 , was examined by pulse - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) . pathological status of the patients was performed according to the modified sydney - system and genotype / status of vaca / caga genes was determined by pcr . pfge was performed using xbai restriction - endonuclease and the field inversion - gel electrophoresis system.findings:no significant relationship was observed between the patterns of pfge and the caga / vaca status / genotype . also no relationship was observed between age , sex , and pathological status of the children and the pfge patterns of their isolates . similar conclusion was obtained by total lab software . however , more relationship was observed between the strains isolated in the close period ( 19972009 , 20012003 , 20052007 , and 20072009 ) and more difference was observed among those obtained in the distant periods ( 1997 and 2009).conclusion : h . pylori strains isolated from children in iran are extremely diverse and this diversity is not related to their virulence characteristics . occurrence of this extreme diversity may be related to adaptation of h. pylori strains to variable living conditions during transmission between various host individuals ."
